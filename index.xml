initialization shock and drift; understanding the onset of model systematic errors; bias correction, calibration, and forecast quality assessment; model resolution; atmosphere–ocean coupling; sources and expectations for predictability; and linking research, operational forecasting, and end-user needs Performance of S2D predictions is strongly tied to initialization of model components beyond the lower atmosphere.</description></item><item><title>S2S</title><link>https://carlos-gg.github.io/digitalgarden/AI4ES/S2S/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://carlos-gg.github.io/digitalgarden/AI4ES/S2S/</guid><description>See:
