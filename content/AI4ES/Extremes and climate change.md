	- The website Carbon Brief has just published an update of its map of all the attribution studies that have looked at the https://www.carbonbrief.org/mapped-how-climate-change-affects-extreme-weather-around-the-world. For now, the map still shows a heavy bias towards events in Europe, North America and Australia, and also towards heatwaves. However, with every update it is becoming more and more comprehensive as the science evolves and includes a more diverse set of events.

## Atribution studies
Attribution studies remain our best (and only) tool for understanding the impact of climate change on extreme weather and on our daily lives. They play a key role in helping [decision makers plan for, or avoid, a future where extreme weather events](https://www.climatecentre.org/news/1253/climate-attribution-work-in-mit-review-ten-a-breakthrough-technologiesa-for-2020) are more likely and intense due to global warming.
Attribution studies are also really important within climate science as they bridge the gap between observations and model projections. They test climate models in a real-world context, allowing scientists to understand better where they can have more confidence in their projections and where model improvements are needed before projections can be used for decision making.
