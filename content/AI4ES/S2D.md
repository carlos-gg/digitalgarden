	- Decadal climate prediction, where climate models are initialized with the contemporaneous state of the Earth system and run for a decade into the future, represents a new source of near-term climate information to better inform decisions and policies across key climate-sensitive sectors
	- This paper illustrates the potential usefulness of such predictions for building a climate service for agricultural needs
	- In particular, we assess the forecast quality of multi-model climate predictions in estimating two user-relevant drought indices, Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI) and Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI), at multi-annual timescales during European summer

	- The S2S and S2D communities share common scientific and technical challenges: forecast initialization and ensemble generation; initialization shock and drift; understanding the onset of model systematic errors; bias correction, calibration, and forecast quality assessment; model resolution; atmosphereâ€“ocean coupling; sources and expectations for predictability; and linking research, operational forecasting, and end-user needs
	- Performance of S2D predictions is strongly tied to initialization of model components beyond the lower atmosphere. For example, stratospheric initial conditions are a source of seasonal winter NAO skill, and ocean initial conditions are crucial for skillfully predicting ENSO, as well as decadal variability in the subpolar North Atlantic
	- Many decisions are made on the S2S forecasting time scale, which sits between weather forecasts and S2D climate outlooks; therefore, the continued development of S2S forecasts has the potential to benefit many sectors of society
