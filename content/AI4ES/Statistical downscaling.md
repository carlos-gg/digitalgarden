- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downscaling
- Downscaling is any procedure to infer high-resolution information from low-resolution variables. This technique is based on dynamical or statistical approaches commonly used in several disciplines, especially meteorology, climatology and remote sensing. The term downscaling usually refers to an increase in spatial resolution, but it is often also used for temporal resolution.
- Statistical downscaling or what climate can I expect in my own backyard? Statistical DS learns a functional mapping between low and high-resolution climate models from observed data (computationally efficient and scalable across multi-model ensembles) vs dynamical DS, where all the local processes are encoded, such as convective precipitation and vegetation schemes, with subgrid parameters and GCM boundary conditions for HR projections (high computational costs) 
- "downscaling" is a climate modeling term while "downsampling" comes from signal processing. Confusingly, "downscaling" is actually equivalent to "upsampling", both referring to "increasing resolution"

	- Precipitation use case. PRISM dataset at a 4km daily spatial resolution which aggregates station observations to a grid with physical and topographical information
	- Upscaled the precipitation data to1/8º (12.5km) as our high-resolution observations. Then upscaled further to 1º corresponding to a low-resolution precipitation
	- SD is the problem of mapping a low-resolution climate variable to a high-resolution projection
	- Using the analogy between climate datasets and images, we can relate statistical downscaling to image super-resolution, where one aims to learn a mapping from low- to high-resolution image pairs
	- Local scale projections can be obtained using statistical downscaling, a technique which uses historical climate observations to learn a low-resolution to high-resolution mapping
	- Used static high-resolution topography (elevation from Global 30 Arc-Second Elevation DataSet (GTOPO30) provided by the USGS) data in conjunction with other low-resolution climate variables
	- DeepSD is a generalized stacked super resolution convolutional neural network (SRCNN) framework for statistical downscaling of climate variables
	- each SRCNN increases the resolution by a factor of s and is trained independently (associated input/output pairs)
	- DeepSD augments SRCNN with multi-scale input channels to maximize predictability in statistical downscaling
	- Future work: more variables such as temperature, wind, humidity at different pressure levels, downscaling multiple climate variables (temp, prlr), uncertainty

	- hybrid dynamical-statistical downscaling approach is an effort to combine the ability of dynamical downscaling to resolve fine-scale climate changes with the low computational cost of statistical downscaling
	- dynamical downscaling was performed with an RCM driven by the reanalysis to produce nested 30- and 6-km resolution simulations. Subsequently, the 6-km simulation was compared to rain gauge data to examine the ability of the RCM to reproduce known climate conditions. Then, in the statistical downscaling step, the ANN was trained to predict rainfall in the 6-km domain based on weather predictors in the 30-km simulation
	- a Simple multilayer perceptron ANN is used

	- DNN to learn a high-resolution representation from low-resolution predictions using weather forecast as a practical use case
	- Supervised learning approach, since obtaining labeled data can be done automatically
	- The input is a set of n low-resolution forecasts from n different weather models. 
	- Each input is interpolated so that they have the same horizontal dimension
	- The input volume is fed into a series of convolutions which are initialized with an approximate delta function up to the last but one layer
	- The architecture is configurable and supports n−1 identity convolutions
	- Results show significant improvement when compared with standard practices and the strategy is still lightweight enough to run on modest computer systems

	- #CODE https://github.com/jleinonen/downscaling-rnn-gan
	- Precipitation use case
	- Introduced a recurrent, stochastic super-resolution GAN that can generate ensembles of time-evolving high-resolution atmospheric fields for an input consisting of a low-resolution sequence of images of the same field
	- Used two datasets: radar-measured precipitation from Switzerland and cloud optical thickness derived from the Geostationary Earth Observing Satellite 16 (GOES-16)
	- The statistical properties of the generated ensemble are analyzed using rank statistics, a method adapted from ensemble weather forecasting. These analyses indicate that the GAN produces close to the correct amount of variability in its outputs
	- Model: 
		- Uses residual blocks
		- Uses ConvGRU layers to learn the temporal evolution of the fields
		- As the GAN generator is fully convolutional, it can be applied after training to input images larger than the images used to train it
	- Compared to Lanczos interpolation, a recurrent CNN (RCNN) trained to optimize RMSE, and the Rain-fall Filtered Autoregressive Model (RainFARM) algorithm. The RCNN uses the same architecture as our GAN generator, except with the noise input disabled

	- Applied the empirical-statistical downscaling method EPISODES, a perfect prognosis method based on large-scale predictors for the variables of interest
	- The predictors of temperature and precipitation were determined by cross-validation to produce low-biased output for the considered region
	- No relevant increase or decrease of hindcast skill in terms of ACC due to downscaling could be detected for the two case study regions
	- The skill remains about the same, but the seasonal data is now available at a higher spatial resolution (approx. 6 km)
	- ANAREG, analogs (by grid point, in a 5x5 window, 20 days in the past)

	- SD with a perfect prognosis approach to produce seasonal predictions of near-surface wind speeds at the local scale
	- Hybrid predictions combine a dynamical prediction of the four main Euro-Atlantic Teleconnections (EATC) and a multilinear statistical regression (fitted with observations and EATC)
	- Comparison with hybrid preds. from ERA5 100-metre wind speed (observational reference)
	- SD techniques are either in:
		- perfect prognosis: model is fitted with observational data for both predictors and predictands
		- model output statistics: using data from a GCM
	- Selection of predictors is vital

	- Super Resolution Deep Residual Network (SRDRN) for downscaling daily precipitation and temperature
	- transfer learning, the trained SRDRN model in one region was directly applied to downscale precipitation in another region with a different environment, and the results showed notable improvement compared to classic statistical downscaling method
	- The outstanding performance of the SRDRN approach stemmed from its ability to fully extract spatial features without suffering from degradation and overfitting issues due to the incorporations of residual blocks, batch normalizations, and data augmentations

	- ConvCNPs are a recently developed class of models that allow deep learning techniques to be applied to off-the-grid spatio-temporal data
	- This model has a substantial advantage over existing downscaling methods in that the trained model can be used to generate multisite predictions at an arbitrary set of locations, regardless of the availability of training data
