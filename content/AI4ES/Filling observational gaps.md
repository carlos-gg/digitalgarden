	- CLIMFILL fills gaps in gridded geoscientific observational data by taking into account spatial neighborhood, temporal context and multivariate dependencies. It takes a multivariate dataset with any number and pattern of missing values per variable and returns the dataset with all missing points replaced by estimates
