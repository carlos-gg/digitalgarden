- [Data for good (France)](https://dataforgood.fr/)
	- Les technologies numériques sont incroyablement puissantes et redéfinissent le fonctionnement de notre société. Mais tous les domaines ne se transforment pas à la même vitesse. Très souvent, les acteurs qui œuvrent pour l’intérêt général (citoyens, associations, institutions publiques et entreprises à fort impact social) sont en retard par rapport aux startups et aux géants de la tech. Data for Good existe pour rétablir l’équilibre.
