## Resources
- [Devpost - social good challenges](https://devpost.com/hackathons?themes[]=Social%20Good)
	- [Big data for social good (IBM)](https://ibmhadoop.devpost.com/)
		- IBM invites developers and data enthusiasts to take a deep dive into real world civic issues using big data and IBM Bluemix’s Analytics for Hadoop service. Analyze one of our curated datasets or bring your own (provided it meets these requirements)! Use Hadoop and your data to create a clickable and interactive data visualization to highlight insights that you’ve found.
- [Omdena](https://omdena.com/projects)
	- A platform to bring together the global AI community with impact-driven organizations to educate, innovate, and build real-world AI solutions
- [Data Science Bowl](https://datasciencebowl.com/)
	- For us, data science is more than a skill or profession. It is a calling and a way of life. It rewards grit as much as talent. Failure, curiosity, and small successes lead to discovery. Data science grants the power of entire nations or corporations to the individual. It gives a megaphone to those who were previously silent. Our purpose is bigger than any one of us.
- [Call for Code - Global](https://callforcode.org/)
	- Developers have revolutionized the way people live and interact with virtually everyone and everything. Where most people see challenges, developers see possibilities. That’s why David Clark Cause is launching Call for Code alongside Founding Partner IBM. This multi-year global initiative is a rallying cry to developers to use their skills and mastery of the latest technologies, and to create new ones, to drive positive and long-lasting change across the world with their code. The inaugural Call for Code Challenge theme is Natural Disaster Preparedness and Relief.
- [Zindi](https://zindi.africa/)
- [Data Science for good on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/search?q=data+science+for+good)
	- Zindi hosts the largest community of African data scientists, working to solve the world’s most pressing challenges using machine learning and AI. We connect data scientists with organisations, and provide a place to learn, hone your skills and find a job. We want to transform the African continent and showcase African data science talent to the world

- [Driven Data competitions](https://www.drivendata.org/competitions/)
	- At DrivenData, we bring cutting-edge practices in data science and crowdsourcing to some of the world's biggest social challenges and the organizations taking them on. We host online challenges, usually lasting 2-3 months, where a global community of data scientists competes to come up with the best statistical model for difficult predictive problems that make a difference.
- [AI to solve the world's challenges (IBM, XPrize)](https://www.xprize.org/prizes/artificial-intelligence)
	- The $5 million IBM Watson AI XPRIZE is a global competition challenging teams to develop and demonstrate how humans can collaborate with powerful AI technologies to tackle the world’s Grand Challenges.
