title: "Implicit Neural Representations"
---

> Implicit Neural Representations, sometimes also referred to as coordinate-based representations, are a novel way to parameterize signals (of all kinds) as a _continuous function_ that maps the domain of the signal (i.e., a coordinate, such as a pixel coordinate for an image) to whatever is at that coordinate (for an image, an R,G,B color). Of course, these functions are usually not analytically tractable - it is impossible to "write down" the function that parameterizes a natural image as a mathematical formula. Implicit Neural Representations thus approximate that function via a neural network
