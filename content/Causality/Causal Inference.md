title: Causal Inference
---

> Causal inference in machine learning refers to the process of identifying the causal relationships between variables in a dataset, often using techniques such as structural equation modeling (SEM), directed acyclic graphs (DAGs), and counterfactual reasoning. The goal is to estimate the causal effects of interventions or treatments on outcomes, allowing for the prediction of future behavior and decision-making under uncertainty.
