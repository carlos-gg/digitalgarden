> DL is used in the domain of digital image processing to solve difficult problems (e.g.image colorization, classification, segmentation and  detection). DL methods such as CNNs mostly improve prediction performance using big data and plentiful computing resources and have pushed the boundaries of what was possible. Problems which were assumed to be unsolvable are now solved with super-human accuracy (eg image classification). Since being reignited by Krizhevsky, Sutskever and Hinton in 2012, DL has dominated the domain ever since due to a substantially better performance compared to traditional methods.

	- involution is a general-purpose neural primitive that is versatile for a spectrum of deep learning models on different vision tasks
	- involution bridges convolution and self-attention in design, while being more efficient and effective than convolution, simpler than self-attention in form
	- the proposed involution operator could be leveraged as fundamental bricks to build the new generation of neural networks for visual recognition, powering different deep learning models on several prevalent benchmarks
