	- Diffusion models are a class of likelihood-based models that have shown to produce high-quality images with desired properties such as distribution coverage and easy scalability. These models generate samples by gradually removing noise from a signal. Previous research has shown that they improve reliably with increased compute. The proposed method brings improvements to diffusions models that have worked for GANs, such as improved model architecture and a scheme to trade off diversity for quality. The proposed diffusion model achieves several state-of-the-art results, surpassing GANs on several metrics and datasets
