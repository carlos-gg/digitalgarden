title: "Diffusion models"
---

> Diffusion Models are generative models that work by destroying training data through the successive addition of Gaussian noise, and then learning to recover the data by reversing this noising process. After training, the Diffusion Model can be used to generate data by simply passing randomly sampled noise through the learned denoising process

	- Diffusion models are a class of likelihood-based models that have shown to produce high-quality images with desired properties such as distribution coverage and easy scalability. These models generate samples by gradually removing noise from a signal.
	- The proposed method brings improvements to diffusions models that have worked for GANs, such as improved model architecture and a scheme to trade off diversity for quality. The proposed diffusion model achieves several state-of-the-art results, surpassing GANs on several metrics and datasets
