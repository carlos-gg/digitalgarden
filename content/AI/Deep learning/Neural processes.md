title: "Neural processes"
---

> A Neural Process (NP) is a map from a set of observed input-output pairs to a predictive distribution over functions, which is designed to mimic other stochastic processes' inference mechanisms. NPs define distributions over functions, are capable of rapid adaptation to new observations, and can estimate the uncertainty in their predictions
