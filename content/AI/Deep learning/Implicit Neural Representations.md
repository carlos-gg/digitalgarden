> Implicit Neural Representations (sometimes also referred to as coordinate-based representations) are a novel way to parameterize signals of all kinds. Implicit Neural Representations parameterize a signal as a _continuous function_ that maps the domain of the signal (i.e., a coordinate, such as a pixel coordinate for an image) to whatever is at that coordinate (for an image, an R,G,B color)
