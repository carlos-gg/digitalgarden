- Granger causality: 
	- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Granger_causality
	- The Granger causality test is a statistical hypothesis test for determining whether one time series is useful in forecasting another, first proposed in 1969
	- Granger causality is a fundamental technique for causal inference in time series data, commonly used in the social and biological sciences
- PCMCI:
	- https://jakobrunge.github.io/tigramite/#tigramite-pcmci-pcmci
	- PCMCI causal discovery for time series datasets. It is a 2-step causal discovery method for large-scale time series datasets. The first step is a condition-selection followed by the MCI conditional independence test.

	- Learning causal relations, rather than correlations, is a fundamental problem in both statistical [[Machine Learning]] and computer sciences
	- Bayesian networks (BNs) can capture causal relations, but learning such a network from data is NP-hard
	- Recent work has made it possible to approximate this problem as a continuous optimization task that can be solved efficiently with well-established numerical techniques
	- BNs encode the conditional independencies between variables using directed acyclic graphs (DAGs)

	- #CODE https://github.com/adamrupe/spacetime_autoencoders
	- Local causal states are latent representations that capture organized pattern and structure in complex spatiotemporal systems
	- We expand their functionality, framing them as space-time autoencoders
