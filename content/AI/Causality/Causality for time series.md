- [Granger causality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Granger_causality)
	- The Granger causality test is a statistical hypothesis test for determining whether one time series is useful in forecasting another, first proposed in 1969
	- Granger causality is a fundamental technique for causal inference in time series data, commonly used in the social and biological sciences
- PCMCI:

	- PCMCI causal discovery for time series datasets. It is a 2-step causal discovery method for large-scale time series datasets. The first step is a condition-selection followed by the MCI conditional independence test.
