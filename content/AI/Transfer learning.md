- Domain adaptation: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_adaptation
	- Domain adaptation is a field associated with machine learning and transfer learning. This scenario arises when we aim at learning from a source data distribution a well performing model on a different (but related) target data distribution


## Code
- #CODE TLlib: https://github.com/thuml/Transfer-Learning-Library
	- open-source and well-documented library for Transfer Learning. It is based on pure PyTorch with high performance and friendly API
