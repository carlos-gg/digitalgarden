## Code
- #CODE [Darts](https://github.com/unit8co/darts)
	- https://unit8co.github.io/darts/
	- Python library for easy manipulation and forecasting of time series. It contains a variety of models, from classics such as ARIMA, Prophet,  deep neural networks (NBEATS, RNNs, Transformers)
	- https://towardsdatascience.com/darts-swiss-knife-for-time-series-forecasting-in-python-f37bb74c126
- #CODE [Prophet (Facebook)](https://github.com/facebook/prophet)
	- https://facebook.github.io/prophet/
	- Prophet is a procedure for forecasting time series data based on an additive model where non-linear trends are fit with yearly, weekly, and daily seasonality, plus holiday effects. It works best with time series that have strong seasonal effects and several seasons of historical data.
