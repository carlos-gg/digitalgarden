> Unsupervised machine learning is the machine learning task of inferring a function to describe hidden structure from "unlabeled" data (a classification or categorization is not included in the observations)

### Kernel density estimation
- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kernel_density_estimation
- kernel density estimation (KDE) is a non-parametric way to estimate the probability density function of a random variable

### Blind source separation
- Blind signal separation (BSS), also known as blind source separation, is the separation of a set of source signals from a set of mixed signals, without the aid of information (or with very little information) about the source signals or the mixing process.

#### Independent component analysis (ICA)
- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_component_analysis
- In signal processing, independent component analysis (ICA) is a computational method for separating a multivariate signal into additive subcomponents. This is done by assuming that the subcomponents are non-Gaussian signals and that they are statistically independent from each other.
