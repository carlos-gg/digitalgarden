> In ML, feature learning or representation learning is a set of techniques that allows a system to automatically discover the representations needed for feature detection or classification from raw data. This replaces manual feature engineering and allows a machine to both learn the features and use them to perform a specific task.

### Unsupervised case
- When the feature learning is performed in an unsupervised way, it enables a form of semisupervised learning where features learned from an unlabeled dataset are then employed to improve performance in a supervised setting with labeled data

### Supervised case
- See [[AI/Deep learning/DL]]
- Representational Learning (RL) refers to learning latent representations using non-parametric (i.e. non-statistical) methods to _extract features_
- Deep supervised models (Multilayer perceptron, Supervised neural networks) are able to learn automatically features from data
