- In machine learning, feature learning or representation learning is a set of techniques that allows a system to automatically discover the representations needed for feature detection or classification from raw data. This replaces manual feature engineering and allows a machine to both learn the features and use them to perform a specific task.

## Unsupervised case
- Dictionary learning
- Autoencoders
- ICA
- Matrix factorization

## Supervised case
- Deep supervised models (Multilayer perceptron, Supervised netural networks) are able to learn automatically features from data.
