- #PAPER [PyTorch: An Imperative Style, High-Performance Deep Learning Library (Paszke 2019)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.01703)
	- Deep learning frameworks have often focused on either usability or speed, but not both. PyTorch is a machine learning library that shows that these two goals are in fact compatible: it provides an imperative and Pythonic programming style that supports code as a model, makes debugging easy and is consistent with other popular scientific computing libraries, while remaining efficient and supporting hardware accelerators such as GPUs
