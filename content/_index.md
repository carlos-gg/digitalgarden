Welcome to my personal digital garden, a collection of notes and resources that I started to compile a couple of years ago as my best attempt to become a somewhat functional _information junkie_. Here I curate, organize and catalog the stuff I ~~read~~ [skim over](https://learningcenter.unc.edu/tips-and-tools/skimming/) everyday. 

The concept of a digital or knowledge garden, a.k.a. "second brain", has been around for quite [some time](https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history) and is related to that of [personal knowledge management](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_knowledge_management). Digital gardens build upon note-taking methodologies such as [Zettelkasten](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zettelkasten) or [Evergreen](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/Evergreen_notes). In short, a digital garden is something in between a blog and a wiki; a way to accumulate personal knowledge over time in an explorable space and in a non-linear fashion, while benefiting from fancy features such as (bidirectional) links between different topics, and visual graphs ([mind maps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind_map)). [This GitHub repository](https://github.com/MaggieAppleton/digital-gardeners) has a nice list of tools and workflows for aspiring gardeners wishing to grow a knowledge garden. Throughout my journey with personal knowledge management, I have used a combination of different tools and practices with varying levels of success: curating lists of links as bookmarks or [Pocket](https://getpocket.com/) collections, compiling notes with [Evernote](https://evernote.com/) or [OneNote](https://www.microsoft.com/es-es/microsoft-365/onenote/digital-note-taking-app), organizing ideas in mind maps with [XMind](https://www.xmind.net/), and collecting bibliographic data in [Zotero](https://www.zotero.org/). Nowadays, I use [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) for growing my digital garden and to manage my markdown notes locally. Although Obsidian cannot fully replace all one of the aforementioned tools, it comes really close and provides convenient workflows for personal knowledge management. Apart from Obsidian, I use [Quartz](https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/) for publishing and sharing the content of my vault using [GitHub pages](https://carlos-gg.github.io/digitalgarden/). 

Keeping up with the literature related to Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) is ~~impossible~~ very difficult and, although tools like the [Deep Learning Monitor](https://deeplearn.org/) might be of help, the "Fear Of Missing Out" [(FOMO)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fear_of_missing_out) information is hardly avoidable, especially if you are an _information junkie_ like me. While my personal digital garden is mainly focused on AI, it is [not meant to be a complete](https://nick.groenen.me/notes/digital-garden-notes-may-be-incomplete/) or exhaustive mapping of all there is to know about AI or ML. It is also not aimed at teaching anyone or to be pedagogical, though it can certainly point you to a multitude of educational resources. The content of this knowledge garden is based merely on my personal research notes, the topics that I have been interested in or that I have come across in my work as a researcher in AI/ML applied to Earth Sciences. That said, feel free to look around, check out the [full list of notes](/AI/), or use the mind map on top of the page for an interactive view of the entries of the garden. Expect broken links and all sort of bugs and errors.

Most notes in the digital garden are focused on specific topics (e.g., [Clustering](AI/Unsupervised%20learning/Clustering.md)) but some are broader ["maps of content"](https://jing.io/garden/MOC/) (e.g., [Deep Learning](AI/Deep%20Learning/Deep%20Learning.md)). The notes are composed of common subsections:

- **Resources**: definitions, wikipedia entries, blog posts, non-peer-reviewed articles and other useful resources.
- **Books**: well... books, mostly free or open source.
- **Courses**: online and free/open courses mostly by recognized universities and institutions.
- **References**: peer-review publications and papers.
- **Code**: open source code and useful libraries.
- **Talks**: talks, video summaries and video podcasts.

Most of the entries (bullet points) in a note carry a specific tag, depending on the subsections they belong to, for example: _#PAPER_,  _#COURSE_, _#BOOK_ or _#CODE_. These are some "maps of content" or important pages you may want to start from:

- [AI](AI/AI.md)
- [Deep Learning](AI/Deep%20Learning/Deep%20Learning.md)
- [Machine Learning](AI/Machine%20Learning.md) 
- [Data Science](AI/Data%20Science,%20Data%20Engineering/Data%20Science.md)
- [AI for good](AI4G/AI4good.md)

I hope you find something useful in this digital garden. Enjoy and use at your own risk!
