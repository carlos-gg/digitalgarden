Welcome to my personal digital garden, a collection of research and personal notes that I started to complie years ago as my best attempt to become a somewhat functional _information junkie_. In this digital garden, I curate, organize and catalog what I read on my day-to-day life, both personal and academic. 

The concept of a digital garden has been around for quite some time, please [check this great post](https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history) if you want a brief history of digital gardens. The idea of a digital garden is close to that of the [Zettelkasten](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zettelkasten) note-taking system, or personal knowledge management or building a [second brain](https://fortelabs.co/blog/basboverview/). In short, it is something in between a blog and a wiki; a way to accumulate personal knowledge over time in an explorable space and in a non-linear fashion, while benefiting from fancy features like (bidirectional) links between different topics, and visual graphs and mind maps. There are many tools and workflows you could use to grow your digital garden; [check out this repository](https://github.com/MaggieAppleton/digital-gardeners) full of resources for aspiring gardeners. Throughout my journey with personal knowledge management, I have used a combination of different tools and practices with a varying level of success: curating lists of links as bookmarks or [Pocket](https://getpocket.com/) collections, compiling notes on [Evernote](https://evernote.com/) or [OneNote](https://www.microsoft.com/es-es/microsoft-365/onenote/digital-note-taking-app), and organizing ideas in mind maps with [XMind](https://www.xmind.net/). Nowadays, I use [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) for offline management of my garden, in the form of a vault of local markdown notes, and [Quartz](https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/) for publishing/sharing the content of the vault using GitHub pages. 

Keeping up with the literature related to Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) is ~~impossible~~ quite hard and, although tools like the [Deep Learning Monitor](https://deeplearn.org/) might be of help, the [FOMO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fear_of_missing_out) is unavoidable. While my personal digital garden is mainly focused on AI, it is [not meant to be a complete](https://nick.groenen.me/notes/digital-garden-notes-may-be-incomplete/) or exhaustive mapping of all the knowledge around AI or ML. It is also not aimed at teaching anyone or to be pedagogical, but it can certainly point you to a plethora of eductional resources. These are merely my personal research notes, the topics that I have been interested in or that I have come across in my work as a researcher in AI and ML applied to Earth Sciences. That said, feel free to look around, check out the [full list of notes](/AI/), or use the mind map on top for an interactive view of the entries of the garden. Expect broken links and all sort of bugs and errors.

Most notes in the digital garden are focused on specific topics (e.g., [Clustering](AI/Unsupervised%20learning/Clustering.md)) but some are broader [maps of content](https://jing.io/garden/MOC/) (e.g., [Deep Learning](AI/Deep%20Learning/Deep%20Learning.md)). The notes are made of common subsections with entries having common tags (e.g., #PAPER or #COURSE):

- Resources: definitions, wikipedia entries, blog posts, non-peer-reviewed articles and other useful resources.
- Books: well... books (mostly free or open source).
- Courses: online and free/open courses mostly by recognized universities and institutions.
- References: peer-review publications and papers.
- Code: open source code and useful libraries.
- Talks: talks, video summaries and video podcasts.

These are some maps of content or important pages you may want to start from:

- [AI](AI/AI.md)
- [Deep Learning](AI/Deep%20Learning/Deep%20Learning.md)
- [Machine Learning](AI/Machine%20Learning.md) 
- [Data Science](AI/Data%20Science,%20Data%20Engineering/Data%20Science.md)
- [AI for good](AI4G/AI4good.md)

I hope you find something useful in this digital garden. Enjoy and use at your own risk!
