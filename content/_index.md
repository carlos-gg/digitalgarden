title: AI Digital Garden ðŸ¤–ðŸª´ 
---

Welcome to my Artificial Intelligence (AI) digital garden, a collection of research notes that I started to complie years ago as my best attempt to become a more functional information junkie. In this digital garden, I curate, organize and catalog what I read on my day-to-day as a researcher in AI and Machine Learning (ML) applied to Earth Sciences. Keeping up with the literature related to AI and ML is ~~impossible~~ quite hard, and although tools like the [Deep Learning Monitor](https://deeplearn.org/) might help, the [FOMO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fear_of_missing_out) is unavoidable.  

The concept of a digital garden has been around for quite some time and is related to that of a knowledge base, a brain dump, a second brain or [Zettelkasten](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zettelkasten). A digital garden is something in between a blog and a wiki, it's a way to accumulate personal knowledge over time in an explorable space, in a non-linear way and preserving the interconnections between different ideas/topics. Please [check this post](https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history) if you want a brief history of digital gardens. There are many ways to grow your digital garden, [check out this repository](https://github.com/MaggieAppleton/digital-gardeners) for resources for aspiring gardeners). I personally use two amazing tools: [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/), for offline management of my garden (in the form of markdown notes), and [Quartz](https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/) for publishing its content (as the website you are curretnly visiting). 

As said before, this digital garden is centered around AI. It is not meant to be a complete or exhaustive mapping of all the knowledge around AI and ML. These are merely the topics that I have been interested in or that I have come across in my work. Feel free to look around, check the [list of notes](/AI/), or to use the mind map for an interactive view of the entries of the garden. 

Most notes are centered on specific topics and contain common subsections:

- Resources: wikipedia entries, blog posts, non-peer-reviewed articles, etc
- Books: well... books
- Talks: talks, video summaries and video podcasts (mostly free or open source)
- Courses: online and open courses mostly by recognized universities and institutions
- References: peer-review publications and papers
- Code: open source code and libraries

Some important pages:

- [AI](/AI/AI.md)
- [Deep Learning](AI/Deep%20Learning/Deep%20Learning.md)
- [Machine Learning](AI/Machine%20Learning.md) 
- [Data Science](AI/Data%20Science,%20Data%20Engineering/Data%20Science.md)
