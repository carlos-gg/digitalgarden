Welcome to my Artificial Intelligence (AI) digital garden, a collection of research notes that I started to complie years ago as my best attempt to become a more functional information junkie. In this digital garden, I curate, organize and catalog what I read on my day-to-day life as a researcher in AI and Machine Learning (ML) applied to Earth Sciences. Keeping up with the literature related to AI and ML is ~~impossible~~ quite hard, and although tools like the [Deep Learning Monitor](https://deeplearn.org/) might be of help, the [FOMO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fear_of_missing_out) is unavoidable.  

The concept of a digital garden has been around for quite some time, please [check this great post](https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history) if you want a brief history of digital gardens. The idea of a digital garden is close to that of the [Zettelkasten](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zettelkasten) note-taking system, or personal knowledge management or building a [second brain](https://fortelabs.co/blog/basboverview/). In short, it is something in between a blog and a wiki; a way to accumulate personal knowledge over time in an explorable space and in a non-linear fashion, while benefiting from fancy features like (bidirectional) links between different topics, and visual graphs and mind maps. There are many tools and workflows you could use to grow your digital garden; [check out this repository](https://github.com/MaggieAppleton/digital-gardeners) full of resources for aspiring gardeners. I personally use two amazing tools: [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/), for offline management of my garden (in the form of local markdown notes), and [Quartz](https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/) for publishing/sharing its content (the GitHub pages website you are currently visiting). 

As said before, this digital garden is centered around AI but it is [not meant to be a complete](https://nick.groenen.me/notes/digital-garden-notes-may-be-incomplete/) or exhaustive mapping of all the knowledge around AI or ML. It is also not aimed at teaching you anything or to be pedagogical. These are merely my personal research notes, the topics that I have been interested in or that I have come across in my work. Expect broken links and all sort of bugs and errors. That said, feel free to look around, check out the [full list of notes](/AI/), or to use the mind map for an interactive view of the entries of the garden. 

Most notes are focused on specific topics (e.g., [Clustering](AI/Unsupervised%20learning/Clustering.md)) but some are broader [maps of content](https://jing.io/garden/MOC/) (e.g., [Deep Learning](AI/Deep%20Learning/Deep%20Learning.md)). The notes are made of common subsections with entries having common tags (e.g., #PAPER or #COURSE):

- Resources: definitions, wikipedia entries, blog posts, non-peer-reviewed articles and other useful resources.
- Books: well... books (mostly free or open source).
- Talks: talks, video summaries and video podcasts.
- Courses: online and free/open courses mostly by recognized universities and institutions.
- References: peer-review publications and papers.
- Code: open source code and useful libraries.

These are some maps of content or important pages you may want to start from:

- [AI](AI/AI.md)
- [Deep Learning](AI/Deep%20Learning/Deep%20Learning.md)
- [Machine Learning](AI/Machine%20Learning.md) 
- [Data Science](AI/Data%20Science,%20Data%20Engineering/Data%20Science.md)

I hope you find something useful in this digital garden. Enjoy and use at your own risk!
