{"/":{"title":"CarlosGG's Knowledge Garden 🪴","content":"Welcome to my personal digital knowledge garden, a collection of notes and resources that I started to compile a couple of years ago as my best attempt to become a somewhat functional _information junkie_. Here I curate, organize and catalog the stuff I ~~read~~ [skim over](https://learningcenter.unc.edu/tips-and-tools/skimming/) everyday. \n\n## About digital knowledge gardens\n\nThe concept of a digital knowledge garden, a.k.a. \"second brain\", has been around for quite [some time](https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history) and is related to that of [personal knowledge management](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_knowledge_management). Digital gardens build upon note-taking methodologies such as [Zettelkasten](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zettelkasten) or [Evergreen](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/Evergreen_notes). In short, a digital garden is something in between a blog and a wiki; a way to accumulate personal knowledge over time in an explorable space and in a non-linear fashion, while benefiting from fancy features such as (bidirectional) links between different topics, and visual graphs or [mind maps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind_map). This GitHub [repository](https://github.com/MaggieAppleton/digital-gardeners) offers a complete list of tools and workflows for aspiring gardeners wishing to grow a knowledge garden. \n\nThroughout my journey with personal knowledge management, I have used a combination of different tools and practices with varying levels of success: curating lists of links as bookmarks or [Pocket](https://getpocket.com/) collections, compiling notes with [Evernote](https://evernote.com/) or [OneNote](https://www.microsoft.com/es-es/microsoft-365/onenote/digital-note-taking-app), organizing ideas in mind maps with [XMind](https://www.xmind.net/), and collecting bibliographic data in [Zotero](https://www.zotero.org/). Nowadays, I use [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) for growing my digital knowledge garden and managing my markdown notes locally. Although Obsidian cannot fully replace all one of the aforementioned tools, it comes really close to it by providing flexible workflows for personal knowledge management. Apart from Obsidian, I use [Quartz](https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/) for publishing and sharing the content of my vault using [GitHub pages](https://carlos-gg.github.io/digitalgarden/). \n\n## Main motivation for creating this knowledge garden\n\nKeeping up with the literature related to Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) is ~~impossible~~ very difficult and, although tools like the [Deep Learning Monitor](https://deeplearn.org/) might be of help, the \"Fear Of Missing Out\" [(FOMO)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fear_of_missing_out) information is hardly avoidable, especially if you are an _information junkie_ like me. While my personal knowledge garden is mainly focused on AI, it is [not meant to be a complete](https://nick.groenen.me/notes/digital-garden-notes-may-be-incomplete/) or exhaustive mapping of all there is to know about AI or ML. It is also not aimed at teaching anyone or to be pedagogical, though it can certainly point you to a multitude of educational resources. The content of this knowledge garden is based merely on my personal research notes, the topics that I have been interested in or that I have come across in my work as a researcher in AI/ML applied to Earth Sciences. \n\n## What to find in here\n\nMost notes in this knowledge garden are focused on specific topics (e.g., [GFlowNets](AI/Deep%20learning/GFlowNets.md)) but others are broader [_maps of content_](https://jing.io/garden/MOC/) (e.g., [Deep Learning](AI/Deep%20learning/DL.md)). The notes are composed of common subsections:\n\n- **Resources**: definitions, wikipedia entries, blog posts and other useful stuff.\n- **Books**: well... books, mostly free or open source.\n- **Courses**: online and free/open courses mostly by recognized universities and institutions.\n- **References**: peer-reviewed publications and papers.\n- **Code**: open source code and relevant libraries.\n- **Talks**: talks, video summaries and video podcasts.\n\nMost of the entries (bullet points) in a note carry a specific tag, depending on the subsections they belong to, for example: _#PAPER_,  _#COURSE_, _#BOOK_ or _#CODE_. The following are some _maps of content_ or important pages you may want to start from:\n\n- [AI](AI/AI.md)\n- [Deep Learning](AI/Deep%20learning/DL.md)\n- [Machine Learning](AI/Machine%20Learning.md) \n- [Data Science](AI/DS%20and%20DataEng/Data%20Science.md)\n- [AI for good](AI4G/AI4good.md)\n\nFeel free to look around, either by exploring the _maps of content_ above, checking out the main index of [notes related to AI](https://carlos-gg.github.io/digitalgarden/ai/), using the search box, or by interacting with the mind map on top of the page. Expect some broken links and all sort of bugs and errors. I hope you find something useful in this knowledge garden.

Active learning assumes that there is an ‘oracle’, such as a human expert, that can be queried to get ground-truth labels for selected unlabeled instances. \n* There are situations in which unlabeled data is abundant but manually labeling is expensive. In such a scenario, learning algorithms can actively query the user/teacher for labels. This type of iterative supervised learning is called active learning. Since the learner chooses the examples, the number of examples to learn a concept can often be much lower than the number required in normal supervised learning. With this approach, there is a risk that the algorithm be overwhelmed by uninformative examples.\n- [Overview of Active Learning for Deep Learning](https://jacobgil.github.io/deeplearning/activelearning)\n- #PAPER [An open source machine learning framework for efficient and transparent systematic reviews (van de Schoot 2021)](https://www.nature.com/articles/s42256-020-00287-7)\n\t- #CODE https://github.com/asreview/asreview\n\n## References\n- #PAPER [Active learning literature survey (Settles 2010)](http://burrsettles.com/pub/settles.activelearning.pdf)\n- #PAPER [Active Learning for Convolutional Neural Networks: A Core-Set Approach (2018)](https://openreview.net/forum?id=H1aIuk-RW)\n- #PAPER [Rethinking deep active learning: Using unlabeled data at model training (Simeoni 2019)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.08177)\n- #PAPER [Deep Batch Active Learning by Diverse, Uncertain Gradient Lower Bounds (2020)](https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryghZJBKPS )\n\n\n### Active learning for anomaly discovery\n- #PAPER [Incorporating Expert Feedback into Active Anomaly Discovery (Das 2016)](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7837915)\n\t- http://web.engr.oregonstate.edu/~tgd/publications/das-wong-dietterich-fern-emmott-incorporating-expert-feedback-into-active-anomaly-discovery-icdm2016.pdf\n- #PAPER [Deep Active Learning for Anomaly Detection (Pimentel 2018)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.09411)","lastmodified":"2022-03-31T08:22:26.954977114Z","tags":null},"/AI/Anomaly-and-Outlier-Detection":{"title":"Anomaly and Outlier Detection","content":"See \"Active learning for anomaly discovery\" section in [Active learning](AI/Active%20learning.md)\n\n## Resources\n- Most of the outlier detection approaches belong to [Unsupervised learning](AI/Unsupervised%20learning/Unsupervised%20learning.md) although it might be framed as a [Semi-supervised learning](AI/Semi-supervised%20learning.md) problem.

To build a tree (training), the algorithm randomly picks a feature from the feature space and a random split value ranging between the maximums and minimums. This is made for all the observations in the training set. To build the forest a tree ensemble is made averaging all the trees in the forest.\n    - Then for prediction, it compares an observation against that splitting value in a “node”, that node will have two node children on which another random comparisons will be made. The number of “splittings” made by the algorithm for an instance is named: “path length”. As expected, outliers will have shorter path lengths than the rest of the observations.\n- #PAPER [Modeling Extreme Events in Time Series Prediction (Ding 2019)](http://staff.ustc.edu.cn/~hexn/papers/kdd19-timeseries.pdf)\n- #PAPER [Bayesian Anomaly Detection and Classification (2019)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.08627  )\n\n\n### DL-based\nSee \"GANs for anomaly detection\" section in [GANs](AI/Deep%20learning/GANs.md)\n\n- #PAPER [Learning Deep Features for One-Class Classification (Perera 2018)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.05365)\n- #PAPER [Deep One-Class Classification (Ruff 2018)](http://proceedings.mlr.press/v80/ruff18a.html)\n- #PAPER [Learning and Evaluating Representations for Deep One-Class Classification (Sohn 2021)](https://openreview.net/forum?id=HCSgyPUfeDj)\n\t- #CODE https://github.com/google-research/deep_representation_one_class\n\t- https://ai.googleblog.com/2021/09/discovering-anomalous-data-with-self.html\n- #PAPER [VOS: Learning What You Don't Know by Virtual Outlier Synthesis (Du 2022)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2202.01197)\n\t- #CODE https://github.com/deeplearning-wisc/vos\n\t- [Paper explained](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-J4T3uLC9M\u0026list=WL\u0026index=59\u0026t=4s)\n\n#### Code\n- #CODE [Anomalib](https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/anomalib)\n\t- An anomaly detection library comprising state-of-the-art algorithms and features such as experiment management, hyper-parameter optimization, and edge inference\n\t- https://openvinotoolkit.github.io/anomalib/\n\t- Anomalib is a deep learning library that aims to collect state-of-the-art anomaly detection algorithms for benchmarking on both public and private datasets\n- #CODE [Orion - A machine learning library for detecting anomalies in signals](https://github.com/signals-dev/Orion) ^oriontfanomalies\n\t- https://sintel.dev/Orion/\n\t- Orion is a machine learning library built for unsupervised time series anomaly detection","lastmodified":"2022-03-31T08:22:26.954977114Z","tags":null},"/AI/AutoML":{"title":"AutoML","content":"See [Model selection and tuning](AI/Supervised%20Learning/Model%20selection%20and%20tuning.md)\n\n## Resources\n- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automated_machine_learning\n- Automated machine learning (AutoML) is the process of automating the process of applying machine learning to real-world problems.

Methods for NAS can be categorized according to the search space, search strategy and performance estimation strategy used:\n\t- The search space defines the type(s) of ANN that can be designed and optimized.\n\t- The search strategy defines the approach used to explore the search space.\n\t- The performance estimation strategy evaluates the performance of a possible ANN from its design (without constructing and training it).\n\n- [Literature on NAS](https://www.automl.org/automl/literature-on-neural-architecture-search/)\n- #PAPER [AdaNet: Adaptive Structural Learning of Artificial Neural Networks (Cortes 2017)](http://proceedings.mlr.press/v70/cortes17a.html)\n\t- https://ai.googleblog.com/2018/10/introducing-adanet-fast-and-flexible.html?m=1\n- #PAPER [Improving Neural Architecture Search Image Classifiers via Ensemble Learning, AdaNas (Macko 2019)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.06236)\n- #PAPER [Up to two billion times acceleration of scientific simulations with deep neural architecture search (Kasim 2020)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.08055)\n- #PAPER [Neural Architecture Search without Training (Mellor 2020)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.04647)\n\t- [Paper explained](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a6v92P0EbJc)\n- #PAPER [Automated Evolutionary Approach for the Design of Composite Machine Learning Pipelines (Nikitin 2021)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.15397)","lastmodified":"2022-03-31T08:22:26.954977114Z","tags":null},"/AI/Automated-planning":{"title":"Automated planning","content":"## Resources\n- AI Planning is a branch of artificial intelligence that concerns the realization of strategies or action sequences, typically for execution by intelligent agents, autonomous robots and unmanned vehicles.

The MAP can be used to obtain a point estimate of an unobserved quantity on the basis of empirical data.It is closely related toFisher's method of maximum likelihood(ML) estimation, but employs an augmented optimization objective which incorporates a prior distribution(that quantifies the additional information available through prior knowledge of a related event) over the quantity one wants to estimate. MAP estimation can therefore be seen as a regularization of ML estimation.\n\n### MLE\n- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maximum_likelihood_estimation\n- Maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) is a method of estimating the parameters of a statistical model given observations, by finding the parameter values that maximize the likelihood of making the observations given the parameters. MLE can be seen as a special case of the maximum a posteriori estimation (MAP) that assumes a uniform prior distribution of the parameters, or as a variant of the MAP that ignores the prior and which therefore is unregularized.\n\n### Bayesian network\n- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayesian_network\n\n### Variational Bayesian methods\n- See [Normalizing flows](AI/Deep%20learning/Normalizing%20flows.md)\n- [Variational Bayesian inference with normalizing flows: a simple example](https://towardsdatascience.com/variational-bayesian-inference-with-normalizing-flows-a-simple-example-1db109d91062)\n\t- #CODE https://github.com/fraseriainlewis/towardsdatascience\n\n### MCMC\nSee MCMC section in [Monte Carlo methods](AI/Math%20and%20Statistics/Monte%20Carlo%20methods.md)\n\n\n## Code\n- #CODE [Stan](https://github.com/stan-dev/stan)\n\t- http://mc-stan.org\n- #CODE [Pymc3 - Probabilistic Programming in Python](http://pymc-devs.github.io/pymc3/)\n- #CODE [Arviz - Exploratory analysis of Bayesian models with Python](https://arviz-devs.github.io/arviz/)\n- #CODE [BayesicFitting - A package for model fitting and bayesian evidence calculation](https://github.com/dokester/BayesicFitting)\n\n\n## Books\n- #BOOK [Think Bayes - Bayesian Statistics Made Simple (Downey 2012)](http://greenteapress.com/wp/think-bayes/)\n\t- Think Bayes is an introduction to Bayesian statistics using computational methods\n- #BOOK [Probabilistic programming and bayesian methods for hackers](http://camdavidsonpilon.github.io/Probabilistic-Programming-and-Bayesian-Methods-for-Hackers/)\n\t- https://github.com/CamDavidsonPilon/Probabilistic-Programming-and-Bayesian-Methods-for-Hackers\n- #BOOK [Bayesian Modeling and Computation in Python (Martin 2021, CRC)](https://bayesiancomputationbook.com/welcome.html)\n\n\n## References\n- #PAPER [Bayesian model selection for complex dynamic systems (Mark 2018)](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-04241-5) ^1ef748","lastmodified":"2022-03-31T08:22:26.954977114Z","tags":null},"/AI/Causality":{"title":"Causality","content":"## Resources\n- [To Build Truly Intelligent Machines, Teach Them Cause and Effect](https://www.quantamagazine.org/to-build-truly-intelligent-machines-teach-them-cause-and-effect-20180515/)\n- [Representing uncertain knowledge](https://glouppe.github.io/info8006-introduction-to-ai/?p=lecture5.md)\n- [Reasoning over time](https://glouppe.github.io/info8006-introduction-to-ai/?p=lecture7.md)\n- [Making decisions](https://glouppe.github.io/info8006-introduction-to-ai/?p=lecture8.md)\n- [Causal Analysis Introduction - Examples in Python and PyMC](https://engl.is/causal-analysis-introduction-examples-in-python-and-pymc.html)\n- [Granger causality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Granger_causality)\n\t- The Granger causality test is a statistical hypothesis test for determining whether one time series is useful in forecasting another, first proposed in 1969\n\t- Granger causality is a fundamental technique for causal inference in time series data, commonly used in the social and biological sciences\n- PCMCI:\n\t- https://jakobrunge.github.io/tigramite/#tigramite-pcmci-pcmci\n\t- PCMCI causal discovery for time series datasets.

DL methods such as CNNs mostly improve  prediction performance using big  data and plentiful computing resources and have pushed the boundaries of what was possible. Problems which were assumed to be unsolvable are now being solved with super-human accuracy. Image classification is a prime example of this. Since being reignited by Krizhevsky, Sutskever and Hinton in 2012, DL has dominated the domain ever since due to a substantially better performance compared to traditional methods.\n- https://github.com/kjw0612/awesome-deep-vision\n- https://github.com/timzhang642/3D-Machine-Learning\n- https://medium.com/@taposhdr/medical-image-analysis-with-deep-learning-i-23d518abf531\n- http://danielnouri.org/notes/2014/12/17/using-convolutional-neural-nets-to-detect-facial-keypoints-tutorial/\n\n- #PAPER [Deep Learning for Computer Vision: A Brief Review (Voulodimos 2017)](https://www.hindawi.com/journals/cin/2018/7068349/)\n- #PAPER [Deep Learning vs. Traditional Computer Vision (O'Mahony 2019)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.13796)\n- #PAPER [Deep learning encodes robust discriminative neuroimaging representations to outperform standard machine learning (Abrol 2021)](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-20655-6)\n- #PAPER [Deep learning-enabled medical computer vision (Esteva 2021)](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41746-020-00376-2)\n- #PAPER [Involution: Inverting the Inherence of Convolution for Visual Recognition, a brand new neural operator (Li 2021)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.06255)\n\t- #CODE https://github.com/d-li14/involution\n\t- [Paper explained](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pH2jZun8MoY\u0026list=WL\u0026index=27\u0026t=641s)\n\t- involution is a general-purpose neural primitive that is versatile for a spectrum of deep learning models on different vision tasks\n\t- involution bridges convolution and self-attention in design, while being more efficient and effective than convolution, simpler than self-attention in form\n\t- the proposed involution operator could be leveraged as fundamental bricks to build the new generation of neural networks for visual recognition, powering different deep learning models on several prevalent benchmarks\n- #PAPER [Unifying Nonlocal Blocks for Neural Networks (Zhu 2021)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.02451v3)\n\t- #CODE https://github.com/zh460045050/SNL_ICCV2021\n\n\n### Traditional CV techniques\n\n#### Background subtraction\nSee [Background subtraction](AI/Computer%20Vision/Background%20subtraction.md)\n\n#### Geometric transformations\n- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometric_transformation\n- https://www.graphicsmill.com/docs/gm/affine-and-projective-transformations.htm\n- https://docs.opencv.org/3.0-beta/doc/py_tutorials/py_imgproc/py_geometric_transformations/py_geometric_transformations.html\n- http://eeweb.poly.edu/~yao/EL5123/lecture12_ImageWarping.pdf\n\n##### Affine transformations \n- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affine_transformation\n- Affine transformations are combinations of linear transformations and translations.

The magnitude encodes how much signal there is at a particular frequency whiel the phase encodes spatial information (indirectly). \n- The Convolution Theorem:\n\t- The Fourier transform of the convolution of two functions is the product of their Fourier transforms\n\t- The inverse Fourier transform of the product of two Fourier transforms is the convolution of the two inverse Fourier transforms\n\t- Convolution in spatial domain is equivalent to multiplication in frequency domain\n\n\n#### Template matching\n- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Template_matching\n\n##### Template based\n- http://aishack.in/tutorials/template-matching/\n- For templates without strong features, or for when the bulk of the template image constitutes the matching image, a template-based approach may be effective.\n- Cross-correlation. Linear filtering: function is a weighted sum/difference of pixel values (dot products at each position)\n\t- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-correlation\n\t- [Convolution and kernels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kernel_(image_processing))\n\t- [Kernels visualization](http://setosa.io/ev/image-kernels/)\n- [Using image pyramids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyramid_(image_processing))\n\n\n##### Feature based\n- Feature-based approach relies on the extraction of image features such, i.e. shapes, textures , colors, to match in the target image or frame. This approach is currently achieved by using Neural Networks and Deep Learning classifiers such as VGG, AlexNet, ResNet. Deep Convolutional Neural Networks process the image by passing it through different hidden layers and at each layer produce a vector with classification information about the image. These vectors are extracted from the network and are used as the features of the image. Feature extraction by using Deep Neural Networks is extremely effective and thus is the standard in state of the art template matching algorithms.\n- This method is considered more robust and is state of the art as it can match templates with non-rigid and out of plane transformation, it can match with high background clutter and illumination changes.\n\n#### Feature extraction\n- The Computer Vision Pipeline, Part 4: feature extraction. https://freecontent.manning.com/the-computer-vision-pipeline-part-4-feature-extraction/\n\t- Feature extraction is a core component of the computer vision pipeline. In fact, the entire deep learning model works around the idea of extracting useful features which clearly define the objects in the image. We’re going to spend a little more time here because it’s important that you understand what a feature is, what a vector of features is, and why we extract features.\n\t- A feature in Machine Learning is an individual measurable property or characteristic of a phenomenon being observed. Features are the input that you feed to your machine learning model to output a prediction or classification. Suppose you want to predict the price of a house, your input features (properties) might include: square_foot, number_of_rooms, bathrooms, etc. and the model will output the predicted price based on the values of your features. Selecting good features that clearly distinguish your objects increases the predictive power of machine learning algorithms.\n- In image processing, algorithms are used to detect and isolate various desired portions or shapes (features) of a digitized image or video stream. It is particularly important in the area of optical character recognition. \n\t- Low-level: Edge detection, Corner detection, Blob detection, Ridge detection, Scale-invariant feature transform,\n\t- Curvature: Edge direction, changing intensity, autocorrelation\n\t- Image motion: Motion detection.

Works with any parameterizable feature (class variables, cluster detection, etc..)\n\t- Flexible methods: Deformable, parameterized shapesActive contours (snakes)\n\n##### Blob detection\n- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blob_detection\n- In computer vision, blob detection methods are aimed at detecting regions in a digital image that differ in properties, such as brightness or color, compared to surrounding regions. Informally, a blob is a region of an image in which some properties are constant or approximately constant; all the points in a blob can be considered in some sense to be similar to each other.\n- [The Laplacian of Gaussian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blob_detection#The_Laplacian_of_Gaussian)\n- [The difference of Gaussians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Difference_of_Gaussians)\n- [The determinant of the Hessian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blob_detection#The_determinant_of_the_Hessian)\n- [The hybrid Laplacian and determinant of the Hessian operator (Hessian-Laplace)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blob_detection#The_hybrid_Laplacian_and_determinant_of_the_Hessian_operator_(Hessian-Laplace))\n- [Maximally stable extremal regions (MSER)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maximally_stable_extremal_regions)\n\n##### Edge detection\n- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Template_matching\n- [Canny edge detector](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canny_edge_detector)\n\t- The Canny edge detector is an edge detection operator that uses a multi-stage algorithm to detect a wide range of edges in images.\n\t- The Process of Canny edge detection algorithm can be broken down to 5 different steps:\n\t\t1. Apply Gaussian filter to smooth the image in order to remove the noise\n\t\t2. Find the intensity gradients of the image\n\t\t3. Apply non-maximum suppression to get rid of spurious response to edge detection\n\t\t4. Apply double threshold to determine potential edges\n\t\t5. Track edge by hysteresis: Finalize the detection of edges by suppressing all the other edges that are weak and not connected to strong edges.\n\t- http://aishack.in/tutorials/canny-edge-detector/\n- Robert cross\n\t- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roberts_cross\n\t- The Roberts cross operator is used in image processing and computer vision for edge detection. \n\t- As a differential operator, the idea behind the Roberts cross operator is to approximate the gradient of an image through discrete differentiation which is achieved by computing the sum of the squares of the differences between diagonally adjacent pixels.\n- Prewitt operator\n\t- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prewitt_operator\n\t- The Prewitt operator is used in image processing, particularly within edge detection algorithms. Technically, it is a discrete differentiation operator, computing an approximation of the gradient of the image intensity function. At each point in the image, the result of the Prewitt operator is either the corresponding gradient vector or the norm of this vector. The Prewitt operator is based on convolving the image with a small, separable, and integer valued filter in horizontal and vertical directions and is therefore relatively inexpensive in terms of computations like Sobel and Kayyali operators. On the other hand, the gradient approximation which it produces is relatively crude, in particular for high frequency variations in the image.\n- Deriche edge detector\n\t- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deriche_edge_detector\n\t- The Prewitt operator is used in image processing, particularly within edge detection algorithms.

An object is recognized in a new image by individually comparing each feature from the new image to this database and finding candidate matching features based on Euclidean distance of their feature vectors. From the full set of matches, subsets of keypoints that agree on the object and its location, scale, and orientation in the new image are identified to filter out good matches. The determination of consistent clusters is performed rapidly by using an efficient hash table implementation of the generalised Hough transform. Each cluster of 3 or more features that agree on an object and its pose is then subject to further detailed model verification and subsequently outliers are discarded. Finally the probability that a particular set of features indicates the presence of an object is computed, given the accuracy of fit and number of probable false matches. Object matches that pass all these tests can be identified as correct with high confidence.\n\t- https://opencv-python-tutroals.readthedocs.io/en/latest/py_tutorials/py_feature2d/py_sift_intro/py_sift_intro.html\n\t- There are mainly five steps involved in SIFT algorithm.\n\t\t1. Scale-space Extrema Detection (using DoG)\n\t\t2. Keypoint Localization\n\t\t3. Orientation Assignment\n\t\t4. Keypoint Descriptor\n\t\t5.

It can be used for tasks such as object recognition, image registration, classification or 3D reconstruction. It is partly inspired by the scale-invariant feature transform (SIFT) descriptor. The standard version of SURF is several times faster than SIFT and claimed by its authors to be more robust against different image transformations than SIFT.\n\n##### Kanade–Lucas–Tomasi (KLT) feature tracker\n- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanade%E2%80%93Lucas%E2%80%93Tomasi_feature_tracker\n- In computer vision, the Kanade–Lucas–Tomasi (KLT) feature tracker is an approach to feature extraction. It is proposed mainly for the purpose of dealing with the problem that traditional image registration techniques are generally costly. KLT makes use of spatial intensity information to direct the search for the position that yields the best match. It is faster than traditional techniques for examining far fewer potential matches between the images.\n- Summary of KLT tracking:\n\t- Find a good point to track (harriscorner)\n\t- Use intensity second moment matrix and difference across frames to find displacement\n\t- Iterate and use coarse-to-fine search to deal with larger movements \n\t- When creating long tracks, check appearance of registered patch against appearance of initial patch to find points that have drifted\n\n##### Optical flow\n- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_flow\n- Vector field function of the spatio-temporal image brightness variations \n- #PAPER [Large Displacement Optical Flow](https://www2.eecs.berkeley.edu/Research/Projects/CS/vision/grouping/papers/brox_cvpr09.pdf)","lastmodified":"2022-03-31T08:22:26.954977114Z","tags":null},"/AI/Computer-Vision/Image-and-video-captioning":{"title":"Image and video captioning","content":"## References\nReview papers: \n- #PAPER [A Systematic Literature Review on Image Captioning (Staniute 2019)](https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3417/9/10/2024/htm)\n- #PAPER [Survey of convolutional neural networks for image captioning (Kalra 2020)](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/02522667.2020.1715602)\n\n- #PAPER [Show and Tell: A Neural Image Caption Generator (Vinyals 2015)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1411.4555)\n- #PAPER [Deep Visual-Semantic Alignments for Generating Image Description](http://cs.stanford.edu/people/karpathy/cvpr2015.pdf)\n\t- http://cs.stanford.edu/people/karpathy/deepimagesent/\n- #PAPER [Mind’s Eye: A Recurrent Visual Representation for Image Caption Generation](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~xinleic/papers/cvpr15_rnn.pdf)\n- #PAPER [Sequence to Sequence--Video to Text](http://arxiv.org/abs/1505.00487)\n- #PAPER [Describing Videos by Exploiting Temporal Structure (Yao 2015)](http://arxiv.org/abs/1502.08029)\n- #PAPER [3G structure for image caption generation (Yuan 2018)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.09544)","lastmodified":"2022-03-31T08:22:26.954977114Z","tags":null},"/AI/Computer-Vision/Image-to-image-translation":{"title":"Image-to-image translation","content":"## Resources\n- The task of Image-to-image translation is to learn the mapping from a given image (X) to a specific target image (Y), e.g., mapping grayscale images to RGB images.\n- Learning the mapping from one visual representation to another requires an understanding of underlying features that are shared between these representations, such features are either domain-independent or domain-specific.\n- https://paperswithcode.com/task/image-to-image-translation\n- https://github.com/weihaox/awesome-image-translation\n- [Deep Domain Adaptation In Computer Vision](https://towardsdatascience.com/deep-domain-adaptation-in-computer-vision-8da398d3167f)\n\n## References\nReview papers:\n- #PAPER [Image-to-Image Translation: Methods and Applications (Pang 2021)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.08629)\n\n\n### CNN-based\nSee [Encoder-decoder networks](AI/Deep%20learning/Encoder-decoder%20networks.md)\n- Related to the task of supervised semantic segmentation but changing the Y and the loss (MAE, MSE or other reconstruction loss)\n\n\n### GAN-based\nSee \"GANs for representation learning and image synthesis\" section in [GANs](AI/Deep%20learning/GANs.md)\n- #PAPER [Deep Generative Adversarial Networks for Image-to-Image Translation: A Review (Alotaibi 2020)](https://www.mdpi.com/2073-8994/12/10/1705/htm#) ^I2IGANs20\n\t- The powerful ability of deep feature learning to automatically utilize complex and high-level feature representations has significantly advanced the performance of state-of-the-art methods across computer applications\n\t- The underlying structure and distinctive (complex) features are both discovered via deep learning-based methods that can be classified further into discriminative feature-learning algorithms and generative feature-learning algorithms\n\t- Discriminative models focus on the classification-learning process by learning the conditional probability p (x|y) to map input x to class label y.

[AlexNet: ImageNet Classification with Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (2012)](https://papers.nips.cc/paper/4824-imagenet-classification-with-deep-convolutional-neural-networks)\n\t- This architecture was one of the first deep networks to push ImageNet Classification accuracy by a significant stride in comparison to traditional methodologies. It is composed of 5 convolutional layers followed by 3 fully connected layers.\n\t- AlexNet, proposed by Alex Krizhevsky, uses ReLu(Rectified Linear Unit) for the non-linear part, instead of a Tanh or Sigmoid function which was the earlier standard for traditional neural networks. Another problem that this architecture solved was reducing the over-fitting by using a Dropout layer after every FC layer.\n- #PAPER [Visualizing and Understanding Convolutional Networks (Zeiler and Fergus 2013)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1311.2901)\n- #PAPER [Very Deep Convolutional Networks for Large-Scale Image Recognition, VGG16 (Symonian 2014)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1409.1556)\n\t- This architecture is from VGG group, Oxford. It makes the improvement over AlexNet by replacing large kernel-sized filters (11 and 5 in the first and second convolutional layer, respectively) with multiple 3X3 kernel-sized filters one after another.\n- #PAPER [Going Deeper with Convolutions (Szegedy 2015)](https://ai.google/research/pubs/pub43022)\n\t- GoogLeNet (Inception-V1, 2015)\n\t- http://nicolovaligi.com/history-inception-deep-learning-architecture.html\n\t- GoogLeNet devised a module called inception module that approximates a sparse CNN with a normal dense construction(shown in the figure). Since only a small number of neurons are effective as mentioned earlier, the width/number of the convolutional filters of a particular kernel size is kept small. Also, it uses convolutions of different sizes to capture details at varied scales(5X5, 3X3, 1X1). Another salient point about the module is that it has a so-called bottleneck layer(1X1 convolutions in the figure). It helps in the massive reduction of the computation requirement. Another change that GoogLeNet made, was to replace the fully-connected layers at the end with a simple global average pooling which averages out the channel values across the 2D feature map, after the last convolutional layer. \n- #PAPER See Resnet in [Residual and dense neural networks](AI/Deep%20learning/Residual%20and%20dense%20neural%20networks.md)\n- #PAPER See Resnext in [Residual and dense neural networks](AI/Deep%20learning/Residual%20and%20dense%20neural%20networks.md)\n- #PAPER See Densenet in [Residual and dense neural networks](AI/Deep%20learning/Residual%20and%20dense%20neural%20networks.md)\n- #PAPER [SqueezeNet: AlexNet-level accuracy with 50x fewer parameters and \u003c0.5MB model size (Iandola 2016)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1602.07360)\n\t- [Paper explained](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ge_RT5wvHvY )\n\t- https://towardsdatascience.com/squeeze-and-excitation-networks-9ef5e71eacd7\n- #PAPER See SENets in [CNNs](AI/Deep%20learning/CNNs.md)\n- #PAPER [Aggregated Residual Transformations for Deep Neural Networks (Xie 2017)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.05431)\n\t- #CODE https://github.com/taki0112/SENet-Tensorflow\n- #PAPER [Designing Network Design Spaces (Radosavovic 2020)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.13678v1)\n- #PAPER [NFNets.

In YOLO a single convolutional network predicts the bounding boxes and the class probabilities for these boxes.\n\t- How YOLO works is that we take an image and split it into an SxS grid, within each of the grid we take m bounding boxes. For each of the bounding box, the network outputs a class probability and offset values for the bounding box. The bounding boxes having the class probability above a threshold value is selected and used to locate the object within the image.\n- #PAPER [RetinaNet.

At its core, RoIPool shares the forward pass of a CNN for an image across its subregions. \n\t- The second insight of Fast R-CNN is to jointly train the CNN, classifier, and bounding box regressor in a single model. \n- #PAPER [Faster R-CNN](https://arxiv.org/abs/1506.01497)\n\t- The insight of Faster R-CNN was that region proposals depended on features of the image that were already calculated with the forward pass of the CNN (first step of classification).\n\t- So why not reuse those same CNN results for region proposals instead of running a separate selective search algorithm?\n\t- A single CNN is used to both carry out region proposals and classification. This way, only one CNN needs to be trained and we get region proposals almost for free. Faster R-CNN adds a Fully Convolutional Network on top of the features of the CNN creating what’s known as the Region Proposal Network.\n- #PAPER [Mask R-CNN (He 2018)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.06870)\n\t- Extending Faster R-CNN for Pixel Level Segmentation\n\t- Mask R-CNN does this by adding a branch to Faster R-CNN that outputs a binary mask that says whether or not a given pixel is part of an object. The branch, as before, is just a Fully Convolutional Network on top of a CNN based feature map. \n\t- But the Mask R-CNN authors had to make one small adjustment to make this pipeline work as expected: Realigning RoIPool to be More Accurate.\n\t- https://engineering.matterport.com/splash-of-color-instance-segmentation-with-mask-r-cnn-and-tensorflow-7c761e238b46\n\t- https://modelzoo.co/model/mask-r-cnn-keras\n\t- https://machinelearningmastery.com/how-to-train-an-object-detection-model-with-keras/","lastmodified":"2022-03-31T08:22:26.954977114Z","tags":null},"/AI/Computer-Vision/Semantic-segmentation":{"title":"Semantic segmentation","content":"See:\n- [Encoder-decoder networks](AI/Deep%20learning/Encoder-decoder%20networks.md) for image segmentation\n- [Object detection](AI/Computer%20Vision/Object%20detection.md)\n\n## Resources\n- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image_segmentation\n- https://github.com/mrgloom/awesome-semantic-segmentation\n- https://blog.athelas.com/a-brief-history-of-cnns-in-image-segmentation-from-r-cnn-to-mask-r-cnn-34ea83205de4\n- [Overview of semantic image segmentation](https://www.jeremyjordan.me/semantic-segmentation/)\n\n## Code\n- #CODE [DeepLab2](https://github.com/google-research/deeplab2)\n\t- DeepLab2 is a TensorFlow library for deep labeling, aiming to provide a unified and state-of-the-art TensorFlow codebase for dense pixel labeling tasks.\n- #CODE [Segmentation models with pretrained backbones (PyTorch)](https://github.com/qubvel/segmentation_models)\n- #CODE https://github.com/qubvel/segmentation_models\n- #CODE https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/images/segmentation\n- #CODE https://github.com/yassouali/pytorch-segmentation\n\n## References\nReview papers:\n- #PAPER [Deep learning for cardiac image segmentation: A review (2019)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.03723)\n- #PAPER [Evolution of Image Segmentation using Deep Convolutional Neural Network: A Survey (Sultana, 2020)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.0407430)\n\n- #PAPER [Fully Convolutional Networks for Semantic Segmentation (Long 2015)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1411.4038)\n- #PAPER [CGNet: A Light-weight Context Guided Network for Semantic Segmentation (Wu 2018)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.08201) ^cgnet\n\t- Context Guided (CG) block learns the joint feature of both local feature and surrounding context, and further improves the joint feature with the global context\n\t- CGNet captures contextual information in all stages of the network and is specially tailored for increasing segmentation accuracy \n\t- CGNet is also elaborately designed to reduce the number of parameters and save memory footprint\n- #PAPER [Panoptic-DeepLab: A Simple, Strong, and Fast Baseline for Bottom-Up Panoptic Segmentation (Cheng 2020)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.10194)\n\t- #CODE https://github.com/bowenc0221/panoptic-deeplab\n- #PAPER [Axial-DeepLab: Stand-Alone Axial-Attention for Panoptic Segmentation (Wang 2020)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.07853)\n\t- #CODE https://github.com/csrhddlam/axial-deeplab\n\t- [Paper explained](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv3UO3G0Ofo)\n- #PAPER [Towards infield, live plant phenotyping using a reduced-parameter CNN (Atanbori 2020)](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs00138-019-01051-7)\n- #PAPER [Learning What Not to Segment: A New Perspective on Few-Shot Segmentation (Lang 2022)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2203.07615v2)","lastmodified":"2022-03-31T08:22:26.954977114Z","tags":null},"/AI/Computer-Vision/Super-resolution":{"title":"Super-resolution","content":"See [Image-to-image translation](AI/Computer%20Vision/Image-to-image%20translation.md)\n\n## Resources\n- [Papers and related resources, mainly state-of-the-art and novel works in ICCV, ECCV and CVPR about image super-resolution and video super-resolution](https://github.com/HymEric/latest-development-of-ISR-VSR)\n- https://github.com/ptkin/Awesome-Super-Resolution\n- https://github.com/ChaofWang/Awesome-Super-Resolution\n- https://keras.io/examples/vision/super_resolution_sub_pixel/\n- [Image Super-Resolution: A Comprehensive Review (2020)](https://blog.paperspace.com/image-super-resolution/ )\n\n\n## Talks\n- #TALK [How Super Resolution Works (2019)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KULkSwLk62I)\n- #TALK [Can you enhance that?

This effectively doubles the number of non-linearities compared to a network using full 3D convolutions for the same number of parameters, thus rendering the model capable of representing more complex functions.The second potential benefit is that the decomposition facilitates the optimization, yielding in practice both a lower training loss and a lower testing loss\n- #PAPER [Video Classification with Channel-Separated Convolutional Networks (Tran 2019)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.02811)\n\t- #CODE https://github.com/facebookresearch/VMZ\n- #PAPER [Dilated 3D Convolutional Neural Networks for Brain MRI Data Classification (Wang 2019)](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8840843)\n- #PAPER [Deep Learning for Spatio-Temporal Data Mining: A Survey (Wang 2019)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.04928)\n- #PAPER [Large-scale weakly-supervised pre-training for video action recognition (Ghadiyaram 2019)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.00561)\n\t- #CODE https://github.com/microsoft/computervision-recipes/tree/master/scenarios/action_recognition\n- #PAPER [Eidetic 3D LSTM A Model for Video Prediction and Beyond, E3D-LSTM (Wang 2019)](https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1lKS2AqtX)\n\t- #CODE https://github.com/google/e3d_lstm\n- #PAPER [Late Temporal Modeling in 3D CNN Architectures with BERT for Action Recognition (Esat Kalfaoglu 2020)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.01232)\n- #PAPER [An Image is Worth 16x16 Words, What is a Video Worth?

create features that make machine learning algorithms work. It is fundamental to the application of ML, and is both difficult and expensive. The need for manual feature engineering can be obviated by automated feature learning\n- http://machinelearningmastery.com/discover-feature-engineering-how-to-engineer-features-and-how-to-get-good-at-it/\n- https://tech.zalando.com/blog/feature-extraction-science-or-engineering/\n\n#### Feature extraction\nSee [Feature learning](AI/Feature%20learning.md) techniques in [Computer vision](AI/Computer%20Vision/Computer%20vision.md)\n\n\n### Data mining\n- http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/ptwobrussell/Mining-the-Social-Web-2nd-Edition/tree/master/ipynb/\n- https://www.dataquest.io/course/apis-and-scraping\n\n#### Web scraping\n- https://www.dataquest.io/blog/web-scraping-tutorial-python/\n- http://thiagomarzagao.com/2013/11/12/webscraping-with-selenium-part-1/\n- https://medium.com/@hoppy/how-to-test-or-scrape-javascript-rendered-websites-with-python-selenium-a-beginner-step-by-c137892216aa#.hrjljvffd\n- https://antonio-maiolo.com/2016/12/01/web-crawler-scrapy-crawl-spider-tutorial/\n- http://stackoverflow.com/questions/19021541/scrapy-scrapping-data-inside-a-javascript\n\n#### API\n- [A categorized public list of APIs from round the web](https://github.com/abhishekbanthia/Public-APIs)\n- [A collective list of public JSON APIs for use in web development](https://github.com/toddmotto/public-apis)\n- [Public APIs](https://public-apis.io/)\n\n\n### Databases\n- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_database\n- [ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACID)\n- [SQL vs NoSQL](http://dataconomy.com/2014/07/sql-vs-nosql-need-know/)\n\n#### SQL\n- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL\n- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relational_database\n- A relational database is a digital database whose organization is based on the relational model of data. \n- https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2017/01/46-questions-on-sql-to-test-a-data-science-professional-skilltest-solution/\n- [Tutorial and exercises](http://sqlzoo.net)\n- [SQL (basic, intermediate, advanced / pet problems)](https://community.modeanalytics.com/sql/tutorial/introduction-to-sql/)\n- [List of SQL Commands](https://www.codecademy.com/articles/sql-commands)\n- [JOIN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Join_(SQL))\n\t- A SQL join clause combines columns from one or more tables in a relational database. It creates a set that can be saved as a table or used as it is. A JOIN is a means for combining columns from one (self-table) or more tables by using values common to each. ANSI-standard SQL specifies five types ofJOIN:INNER,LEFT OUTER,RIGHT OUTER,FULL OUTER and CROSS.\n\t- https://periscopedata.com/blog//how-joins-work.html\n- https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/sqlite-vs-mysql-vs-postgresql-a-comparison-of-relational-database-management-systems\n- Python interface\n\t- https://www.tutorialspoint.com/python/python_database_access.htm\n\t- http://www.python-course.eu/sql_python.php\n\t- https://wiki.python.org/moin/DatabaseInterfaces\n\n#### NoSQL\n- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NoSQL\n- Not only SQL: A NoSQL database provides a mechanism for storage and retrieval of data which is modeled in means other than the tabular relations used in relational databases. NoSQL databases are increasingly used in big data and real-time web applications. Many NoSQL stores compromise consistency (in the sense of theCAP theorem) in favor of availability, partition tolerance, and speed. \n- Column: Accumulo, Cassandra, Druid, HBase, Vertica, SAP HANA \n- #TALK [GOTO 2012 - Introduction to NoSQL - Martin Fowler](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qI_g07C_Q5I)\n- Graph: \n\t- A graph database is a database that uses graph structures for semantic queries with nodes, edges and properties to represent and store data. A key concept of the system is the graph (or edge or relationship), which directly relates data items in the store. The relationships allow data in the store to be linked together directly, and in many cases retrieved with a single operation.\n\t- Graph databases employ nodes, edges and properties.\n\t\t- Nodes represent entities/items you might want to keep track of (people, businesses, accounts).\n\t\t- Edges, also known as graphs or relationships, are the lines that connect nodes to other nodes; they represent the relationship between them.\n\t\t- Properties are pertinent information that relate to nodes (sort of keywords).\n\t\t- AllegroGraph, ArangoDB, InfiniteGraph, Apache Giraph, MarkLogic, Neo4J, OrientDB, Virtuoso, Stardog\n\t\t- https://neo4j.com/developer/graph-database/\n- Key-value\n\t- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key-value_database\n\t- A key-value store, or key-value database, is a data storage paradigm designed for storing, retrieving, and managing associative arrays, a data structure more commonly known today as a dictionary or hash.\n\t- Dictionaries contain a collection of objects, or records, which in turn have many different fields within them, each containing data. These records are stored and retrieved using a key that uniquely identifies the record, and is used to quickly find the data within the database.\n- [Document-oriented database](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Document-oriented_database)\n\n### Data munging\n- https://www.coursera.org/learn/data-cleaning\n\n#### Data preparation\n- Data cleansing: Missing data\n\t- https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/impute.html\n\t- https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2016/01/guide-data-exploration/#two\n\t- https://www.quora.com/How-can-I-deal-with-missing-values-in-a-predictive-model\n- [Variables encoding](http://pbpython.com/categorical-encoding.html)\n- [Normalisation, scaling](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/preprocessing.html)\n- [Outlier detection](https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2016/01/guide-data-exploration/#three)\n\n#### Exploratory data analysis\n- https://www.codementor.io/jadianes/data-science-python-r-exploratory-data-analysis-visualization-du107jjms\n- http://blog.districtdatalabs.com/data-exploration-with-python-2\n- https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2016/01/guide-data-exploration/\n\n\n### Big data\n- http://www.datasciencecentral.com/profiles/blogs/25-big-data-terms-you-must-know-to-impress-your-date-or-whoever\n- [Architecture of Giants: Data Stacks at Facebook, Netflix, Airbnb, and Pinterest](https://blog.keen.io/architecture-of-giants-data-stacks-at-facebook-netflix-airbnb-and-pinterest-9b7cd881af54)\n\n#### MapReduce\n- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MapReduce\n- MapReduce is a programming model and an associated implementation for processing and generating large data sets with a parallel, distributed algorithm on a cluster\n- A MapReduce program is composed of aMap() procedure (method) that performs filtering and sorting (such as sorting students by first name into queues, one queue for each name) and aReduce() method that performs a summary operation (such as counting the number of students in each queue, yielding name frequencies)","lastmodified":"2022-03-31T08:22:26.954977114Z","tags":null},"/AI/DS-and-DataEng/Distributed-DL":{"title":"Distributed Deep learning","content":"## Resources\n- https://d2l.ai/chapter_computational-performance/multiple-gpus.html \n- https://jhui.github.io/2017/03/07/TensorFlow-GPU/ \n- https://www.logicalclocks.com/blog/goodbye-horovod-hello-collectiveallreduce \n- [Twelve ways to fool the masses when reporting performance of deep learning workloads](https://htor.inf.ethz.ch/blog/index.php/2018/11/08/twelve-ways-to-fool-the-masses-when-reporting-performance-of-deep-learning-workloads/)\n- [Distributed Deep Learning 101: Introduction](https://towardsdatascience.com/distributed-deep-learning-101-introduction-ebfc1bcd59d9)\n\n## Talks\n- #TALK [ALCF Datascience frameworks: Tensorflow, PyTorch, Keras, and Horovod](https://www.alcf.anl.gov/files/Zheng_SDL_ML_Frameworks_1.pdf)\n- #TALK [Scaling Deep Learning for Scientific Workloads on the #1 Summit Supercomputer](https://insidehpc.com/2019/04/scaling-deep-learning-for-scientific-workloads-on-the-1-summit-supercomputer/)\n- #TALK [Scaling Neural Networks Training -

Project Jupyter exists to develop open-source software, open-standards, and services for interactive computing across dozens of programming languages. For instance, the Jupyter Notebook is an open-source web-app that allows users to write portable documents containing executable code, narrative text, and equations, and to visualize the results of running the code directly in the web browser. The name comes from a combination of the three core programming languages of Jupyter (Julia, Python and R) though Jupyter is not limited to these languages.  \n- Tools in the Jupyter ecosystem are designed in a modular fashion, and behave similarly on a researcher's laptop, a high-performance computing center, or the cloud. As a result, Jupyter technologies have been widely adopted across a spectrum of scientific disciplines, including Earth Sciences (Perez et al. 2019).  \n- JupyterHub brings the power of notebooks to groups of users. It gives users access to computational environments and resources without burdening the users with installation and maintenance tasks. These are a few examples of JupyterHub systems running on supercomputing systems: \n\t- University Corporation for Atmospheric Research (UCAR, https://jupyterhub.ucar.edu/)  \n\t- CSCS, ETH Zurich (https://jupyter.cscs.ch/hub/login) \n\t- CHPC, University of Utah (https://www.chpc.utah.edu/documentation/software/jupyterhub.php#hub, http://notebook.chpc.utah.edu/) \n\t- Minesota supercomputing institute (https://www.msi.umn.edu/content/msi-beta) \n- A common denominator of these computing platforms is that they allow the interactive execution of Jupyter tools on HPC systems over multiple nodes. The user is offered to choose the job configuration options in order to allocate the resources to be used to run Jupyter: account, number of nodes, access to GPUs, wall-clock time, etc.  \n- [Interactive supercomputing with Jupyter lab](https://www.cscs.ch/publications/news/2019/interactive-supercomputing-with-jupyterlab/)\n\n- #PAPER [Jupyter as common technology platform for interactive HPC services (Milligan 2018)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.09929)\n- #PAPER [Jupyter meets the Earth: Enabling discovery in geoscience through interactive computing at scale (Perez 2019)](https://zenodo.org/record/3369939 )\n- #PAPER [Interactive Supercomputing with Jupyter (Thomas 2021)](https://authorea.com/doi/full/10.22541/au.161230518.84458221) ^thomas21hpcjupyter\n\n\n## Ipython\n- Save interactive ipython session: `%history -f /tmp/history.py`","lastmodified":"2022-03-31T08:22:26.954977114Z","tags":null},"/AI/DS-and-DataEng/ML-Ops":{"title":"Machine Learning Operations (MLOps)","content":"## Resources\n- Set of practices that aims to deploy and maintain machine learning models in production reliably and efficiently.

Traditional autoencoders that just do reconstruction don’t have an obvious generative interpretation. There are some cases in between, like denoising autoencoders, where it is possible to construct a Markov chain that uses the autoencoder to sample from the data distribution, but the autoencoder doesn’t give direct explicit access to an estimate of the density or the ability to sample directly.\n- VAE is a type of autoencoder with added constraints on the encoded representations being learned. More precisely, it is an autoencoder that learns a latent variable model for its input data. So instead of letting your neural network learn an arbitrary function, you are learning the parameters of a probability distribution modeling your data. If you sample points from this distribution, you can generate new input data samples: a VAE is a \"generative model\".\n- [Introduction to deep generative modeling: Variational Auto-Encoders](https://jmtomczak.github.io/blog/4/4_VAE.html)\n- [Introduction to deep generative modeling: Priors in VAEs](https://jmtomczak.github.io/blog/7/7_priors.html)\n- [Introduction to deep generative modeling: Hierarchical VAEs](https://jmtomczak.github.io/blog/9/9_hierarchical_lvm_p1.html)\n- [Variational Autoencoders Explained](http://kvfrans.com/variational-autoencoders-explained/)\n- [Intuitively understanding VAEs](https://towardsdatascience.com/intuitively-understanding-variational-autoencoders-1bfe67eb5daf)\n- [An Intuitive Comparison of Autoencoders with Variational Autoencoders](https://thilospinner.com/towards-an-interpretable-latent-space/)\n- http://blog.fastforwardlabs.com/post/148842796218/introducing-variational-autoencoders-in-prose-and\n- [Arxiv insights.

The approach is an attempt to more closely mimic biological neural organization.\n- The main failure of CNNs is that they do not carry any information about the relative relationships between features (CNNs since they are based on the convolution operation applied to scalar values).\n- Capsules introduce a new building block that can be used in deep learning to better model relationships inside the network. The key to this richer feature representation is the use of vectors rather than scalars.\n- A capsule is an abstract idea of having a group of neurons with an activity vector that contains more information about the object. There are many ways to implement this.

latent variables(\"hidden units\"), with connections between the layers but not between units within each layer.

The nodes of any single layer don’t communicate with each other laterally.\n\t- This stack of RBMs might end with a a Softmax layer to create a classifier, or it may simply help cluster unlabeled data in an unsupervised learning scenario.\n\t- With the exception of the first and final layers, each layer in a deep-belief network has a double role: it serves as the hidden layer to the nodes that come before it, and as the input (or “visible”) layer to the nodes that come after. It is a network built of single-layer networks.\n\t- Deep-belief networks are used to recognize, cluster and generate images, video sequences and motion-capture data. A continuous deep-belief network is simply an extension of a deep-belief network that accepts a continuum of decimals, rather than binary data.

In doing so D is optimized so as to be able to discriminate between examples from the training example and from the generator network which in turn is optimized to fool D into classifying its output as being drawn from the training examples. After such training G can now generate samples with properties very similar to those of the training examples.

It essentially replaces the Jensen Shannon divergence of conventional GANs with the Earth Mover distance (Wasserstein-1 distance or EM distance)\n\t\t- Two Timescale Update Rule (TTUR): In this method, we use a different learning rate for the discriminator and the generator. Typically, a slower update rule is used for the generator and a faster update rule is used for the discriminator\n\t\t- Gradient Penalty: In the paper Wasserstein GAN GP, a simple gradient penalty was introduced which is added to the loss function to avoid exploding vanishing gradients and optimization issues (caused by weight clipping)\n\t\t- Spectral Normalization: weight normalization technique that is typically used on the Discriminator to enhance the training process\n\t\t- [Unrolling and Packing](http://aiden.nibali.org/blog/2017-01-18-mode-collapse-gans/)\n\t\t- Stacking GANs: use multiple GANs placed consecutively, where each GAN solves an easier version of the problem.  For instance, FashionGAN used two GANs to perform localized image translation. Progressive GANs (ProGANs) can generate high quality images of excellent resolution.\n\t\t- Relativistic GANs: Conventional GANs measure the probability of the generated data being real. Relativistic GANs measure the probability of the generated data being “more realistic” than the real data. We can measure this “relative realism” using an appropriate distance measure, as mentioned in the RGAN paper\n\t\t- Self Attention Mechanism (SAGAN): The authors of Self Attention GANs claim that convolutions used for generating images look at information that are spread locally. That is, they miss out on relationships that span globally due to their restrictive receptive field.

And this is because of exploding and vanishing gradients.\n- Then came Sepp Hochreiter and Jürgen Schmidhuber and invented LSTMs, which can remember information from the way past and also selectively forget stuff that is not required.\n- There are several architectures of LSTM units. A common architecture is composed of a cell (the memory part of the LSTM unit) and three \"regulators\", usually called gates, of the flow of information inside the LSTM unit: an input gate, an output gate and a forget gate.

The number of parameters per IndyLSTM layer, and thus the number of FLOPS per evaluation, is linear in the number of nodes in the layer, as opposed to quadratic for regular LSTM layers, resulting in potentially both smaller and faster models. IndyLSTMs, despite their smaller size, consistently outperform regular LSTMs both in terms of accuracy per parameter, and in best accuracy overall. We attribute this improved performance to the IndyLSTMs being less prone to overfitting.\n- #PAPER [Understanding LSTM -- a tutorial into Long Short-Term Memory Recurrent Neural Networks (Staudemeyer 2019)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.09586)","lastmodified":"2022-03-31T08:22:26.958977122Z","tags":null},"/AI/Deep-learning/MLPs":{"title":"Multilayer perceptrons (MLPs)","content":"## Resources\n- A multilayer perceptron (MLP) is a feed forward artificial neural network model that maps sets of input data onto a set of appropriate outputs.

Knowing the dynamics allows us to model the change of an environment, like a physics simulation, unlocking the ability to take any starting condition and model how it will change. With Neural ODEs, we don’t define explicit ODEs to document the dynamics, but learn them via ML.\n\t- Strong connection with [Residual and dense neural networks](AI/Deep%20learning/Residual%20and%20dense%20neural%20networks.md). Why do residual layers help networks achieve higher accuracies and grow deeper? Firstly, skip connections help information flow through the network by sending the hidden state, h(t), along with the transformation by the layer, f(h(t)), to layer t+1, preventing important information from being discarded by f. Secondly, residual layers can be stacked, forming very deep networks.\n\t- However, ResNets still employ many layers of weights and biases requiring much time and data to train. On top of this, the backpropagation algorithm on such a deep network incurs a high memory cost to store intermediate values.\n\t- Continuous depth ODENets are evaluated using black box ODE solvers, but first the parameters of the model must be optimized via gradient descent. To do this, we need to know the gradient of the loss with respect to the parameters, or how the loss function depends on the parameters in the ODENet.\n\t- In deep learning, backpropagation is the workhorse for finding this gradient, but this algorithm incurs a high memory costs to store the intermediate values of the network. On top of this, the sheer number of chain rule applications produces numerical error. Since an ODENet models a differential equation, these issues can be circumvented using sensitivity analysis methods developed for calculating gradients of a loss function with respect to the parameters of the system producing its input.\n\n\n## References\n- #PAPER [Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (TQ Chen 2018)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.07366)\n\t- #CODE https://github.com/JSeam2/Neural-Ordinary-Differential-Equations\n\t- #CODE https://github.com/jason71995/Keras_ODENet\n\t- [Neural Ordinary Differential Equations - Best Paper Awards NeurIPS 2018](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V6nGT0Gakyg)\n\t- https://towardsdatascience.com/paper-summary-neural-ordinary-differential-equations-37c4e52df128\n\t- https://braindump.jethro.dev/posts/neural_ode/\n\t- https://msurtsukov.github.io/Neural-ODE/\n\t- https://github.com/msurtsukov/neural-ode/blob/master/Neural%20ODEs.ipynb\n\t- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jltgNGt8Lpg\n- #PAPER [Augmented Neural ODEs (Dupont 2019)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.01681)\n- #PAPER [Differential Bayesian Neural Nets (Look 2020)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.00796)\n\t- Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (N-ODEs) are a powerful building block for learning systems, which extend residual networks to a continuous-time dynamical system.

The idea is simple, instead of having deterministic weights that we learn, we instead learn the parameters of a random variable which we will use to sample our weights during forward propagation. Then, to learn the parameters, we will use backpropagation, sometimes with a little trick to make our parameters differentiable.\n\t- Dropout is a way to make your Neural Networks Bayesian almost for free, and to use it during inference you just have to keep the Dropout, and sample several models, this is called MC Dropout.\n\n ### Monte Carlo Dropout\n- [What is MC Dropout](https://datascience.stackexchange.com/questions/44065/what-is-monte-carlo-dropout)\n- normal dropout (only at training time) serves as a regularization to avoid overfitting. During test time, dropout is not applied; instead, all nodes/connections are present, but the weights are adjusted accordingly (e.g. multiplied by the keep ratio, which is 1 - dropout_ratio). Such a model during test time can be understood as a *average* of an ensemble of neural networks.\n- Notice that for normal dropout, at test time the prediction is *deterministic*. Without other source of randomness, given one test data point, the model will always predict the same label or value.\n- For *Monte Carlo dropout*, the dropout is applied at both training and test time. At test time, the prediction is no longer deterministic, but depending on which nodes/links you randomly choose to keep. Therefore, given a same datapoint, your model could predict different values each time.\n- The primary goal of MC dropout is to generate random predictions and interpret them as samples from a probabilistic distribution. \n- #TALK [Estimacion de la Incertidumbre en Redes Neuronales (Valdenegro)](https://mvaldenegro.github.io/files/DSRP-meetup-NeurIPS-2020-incertidumbre-redes-neuronales.pdf)\n\n\n## Code\n- #CODE [Pyro (Uber) -

Many other visual recognition tasks have also greatly benefited from very deep models. So, over the years there is a trend to go more deeper, to solve more complex tasks and to also increase /improve the classification/recognition accuracy. But, as we go deeper; the training of neural network becomes difficult and also the accuracy starts saturating and then degrades also. Residual Learning tries to solve both these problems.\n\t- What is Residual Learning?\n\t\t- In general, in a deep convolutional neural network, several layers are stacked and are trained to the task at hand. The network learns several low/mid/high level features at the end of its layers. In residual learning, instead of trying to learn some features, we try to learn some residual. Residual can be simply understood as subtraction of feature learned from input of that layer. ResNet does this using shortcut connections (directly connecting input of nth layer to some (n+x)th layer. It has proved that training this form of networks is easier than training simple deep convolutional neural networks and also the problem of degrading accuracy is resolved.\n\t\t- The architecture is similar to the VGGNet consisting mostly of 3X3 filters. From the VGGNet, shortcut connection as described above is inserted to form a residual network.\n- #PAPER [Aggregated Residual Transformations for Deep Neural Networks, ResNeXt (Xie 2016)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.05431) ^resnext\n- #PAPER [Densely Connected Convolutional Networks, DenseNet (Huang 2016)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1608.06993) ^densenet\n\t- #CODE https://github.com/liuzhuang13/DenseNet\n\t- #BOOK [DenseNet](https://d2l.ai/chapter_convolutional-modern/densenet.html)\n\t- For each layer, the feature-maps of all preceding layers are used as inputs, and its own feature-maps are used as inputs into all subsequent layers. DenseNets have several compelling advantages such as alleviating the vanishing-gradient problem, strengthening the feature propagation, encouraging feature reuse, and substantially reducing the number of parameters. DenseNets outperformed ResNets whilst requiring less memory and computation to achieve high performance.\n\t- https://towardsdatascience.com/review-densenet-image-classification-b6631a8ef803\n\t- In DenseNet, each layer obtains additional inputs from all preceding layers and passes on its own feature-maps to all subsequent layers.

On top of higher translation quality, the Transformer requires less computation to train and is a much better fit for modern machine learning hardware, speeding up training by up to an order of magnitude.\n\t- Self-attention is the method the Transformer uses to bake the “understanding” of other relevant words into the one we’re currently processing. If you’re familiar with RNNs, think of how maintaining a hidden state allows an RNN to incorporate its representation of previous words/vectors it has processed with the current one it’s processing. \n\t- The dominant sequence transduction models are based on complex recurrent or convolutional neural networks in an encoder-decoder configuration. The best performing models also connect the encoder and decoder through an attention mechanism. We propose a new simple network architecture, the Transformer, based solely on attention mechanisms, dispensing with recurrence and convolutions entirely.\n\t- http://jalammar.github.io/illustrated-transformer/\n\t- [Attention is all you need, attentional neural network models (Łukasz Kaiser)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBCqOTEfxvg)\n\t- [LSTM is dead, long live Transformers](https://sea-adl.org/2019/12/03/lstm-is-dead-long-live-transformers/)\n- #PAPER [Tensor2tensor (Vaswani 2018)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.07416)\n\t- Tensor2Tensor, or T2T for short, is a library of deep learning models and datasets designed to make deep learning more accessible and accelerate ML research.

Training data consists of lists of items with some partial order specified between items in each list. This order is typically induced by giving a numerical or ordinal score or a binary judgment (e.g. \"relevant\" or \"not relevant\") for each item. The ranking model's purpose is to rank, i.e. produce a permutation of items in new, unseen lists in a way which is \"similar\" to rankings in the training data in some sense.\n\n### Ordinal regression (classification)\n- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordinal_regression\n- OR (also called \"ordinal classification\" or “ranking learning”) is a type of [Regression](AI/Supervised%20Learning/Regression.md) analysis used for predicting an ordinal variable, i.e. a variable whose value exists on an arbitrary scale where only the relative ordering between different values is significant.

It must satisfy 4 axioms:\n\t1. d(x,y)\u003e=0, no negative distances\n\t2. d(x,y)=0 if and only if x=y, positive distances except the from a point to itself\n\t3. d(x,y) = d(y,x), distance is symmetric \n\t4. d(x,y) \u003c= d(x,z)+d(z,y), the triangle inequality says that to travel from x to y, we cannot obtain any benefit if we are forced to travel via some particular third point z. \n- http://www.benfrederickson.com/distance-metrics/ (notebook kind of post using pandas, d3)\n- https://github.com/andrecosta90/distance-similarity-measures\n\n### Minkowski\n- The Minkowski distance is the generalized Lp -norm of the difference. \n- Lp-norm is the distance d defined as: d = (sum|x_i - y_i|^p)^1/p \n\n### Euclidean\n- Same as L2-norm (Lp-norm when p=2)\n- Most familiar distance measure, defined as the square root of the sum of the square distances: d = sqrt(sum((x_i - y_i)^2)\n- An equivalent to the L2-norm is the Squared Euclidean distance or sum of squared difference (SSD). This is the fundamental metric in least squares problems and linear algebra. It’s very sensitive to outliers (because of the square). The Mean Squared Error (MSE) is the normalized version of the SSD. \n\n### Manhattan\n- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxicab_geometry\n- Same as L1-norm (Lp-norm when p=1)\n- Also known as Taxicab norm and SAD\n- Distance defined as the sum of the absolute differences of the coordinates: d = sum(|x_i - y_i|)\n- In solving an underdetermined system of linear equations, the regularisation term for the parameter vector is expressed in terms of the-norm (taxicab geometry) of the vector. This approach appears in the signal recovery framework called compressed sensing.\n- The Mean-Absolute Error (MAE) is a normalized version of the SAD: d_MAE(x,y) = d_SAD(x,y)/n = 1/n sum(|x_i - y_i|)\n\n### Cosine\n- The cosine distance contains the dot product scaled by the product of the Euclidean distances from the origin. It represents the angular distance of two vectors while ignoring their scale. \n\n### Jaccard\n- The Jaccard distance, is a measure of how _dissimilar_ two sets are. It is the complement of the Jaccard index and can be found by subtracting the Jaccard Index from 100%\n- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaccard_index\n\n### Hamming\n- The hamming distance represents the number of entries in the two sample vectors which are different. It is a fundamental distance measure in information theory but less relevant in non-integer numerical problems. \n\n### Pearson\n- The Pearson distance is a correlation distance based on Pearson's product-momentum correlation coefficient of the two sample vectors. Since the correlation coefficient falls between [-1, 1], the Pearson distance lies in [0, 2] and measures the linear relationship between the two vectors. \nd_pearson(x,y) = 1 - Correlation(x,y)","lastmodified":"2022-03-31T08:22:26.958977122Z","tags":null},"/AI/Math-and-Statistics/Linear-Algebra":{"title":"Linear Algebra","content":"## Resources\n- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_algebra\n- [The Matrix Cookbook (Brandt 2012)](https://www.math.uwaterloo.ca/~hwolkowi/matrixcookbook.pdf)\n- [Stanford, Linear algebra refresher](https://stanford.edu/~shervine/teaching/cme-102/linear-algebra)\n- Stanford CS229, algebra and calculus refresher: \n\t- https://github.com/afshinea/stanford-cs-229-machine-learning/blob/master/en/refresher-algebra-calculus.pdf\n\t- http://cs229.stanford.edu/section/cs229-linalg.pdf\n- http://people.duke.edu/~ccc14/sta-663/LinearAlgebraReview.html\n- https://www.khanacademy.org/math/linear-algebra\n- http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/relopezbriega/relopezbriega.github.io/blob/master/downloads/LinearAlgebraPython.ipynb\n\n### Matrix decompositions\n- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_decomposition\n- http://people.duke.edu/~ccc14/sta-663/LinearAlgebraMatrixDecompWithSolutions.html\n- http://hameddaily.blogspot.be/2016/12/simple-matrix-factorization-with.html\n- https://sites.google.com/site/igorcarron2/matrixfactorizations\n- http://blog.ethanrosenthal.com/2017/06/20/matrix-factorization-in-pytorch/\n- https://tryolabs.com/blog/introduction-to-recommender-systems/\n- Alternating Least-squares\n\t- [Fast Python Collaborative Filtering for Implicit Datasets](https://github.com/benfred/implicit)\n\t- [Recommender system using matrix factorization (SVD, ALS)](http://www.benfrederickson.com/matrix-factorization/)\n- Eigen decomposition: \n\t- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eigendecomposition_of_a_matrix\n\t- http://setosa.io/ev/eigenvectors-and-eigenvalues/\n- [LU decomposition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LU_decomposition)\n- [QR decomposition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QR_decomposition)\n\n#### SVD\n- [Singular Value Decomposition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singular_value_decomposition)\n- https://mathworld.wolfram.com/SingularValueDecomposition.html\n- [Geometric explanation of SVD and applications](http://www.ams.org/publicoutreach/feature-column/fcarc-svd)\n- [Singular Value Decomposition as Simply as Possible](https://gregorygundersen.com/blog/2018/12/10/svd/)\n- https://jeremykun.com/2016/04/18/singular-value-decomposition-part-1-perspectives-on-linear-algebra/\n- #TALK [SVD (MIT, Gilbert Strang)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mBcLRGuAFUk)\n- #TALK [Singular Value Decomposition (SVD): Mathematical Overview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nbBvuuNVfco)\n\n##### Randomized Singular Value Decomposition\n- https://gregorygundersen.com/blog/2019/01/17/randomized-svd/\n- [Fast Randomized SVD (Meta/Facebook research)](https://research.facebook.com/blog/2014/09/fast-randomized-svd/)\n- #TALK [Randomized Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fJ2EyvR85ro)\n\n## Code\n- #CODE [Tensorly](https://github.com/tensorly/tensorly)\n\t- http://tensorly.org\n\t- TensorLy is a Python library that aims at making tensor learning simple and accessible.

Why is correlation a useful metric?\n\t- Correlation can help in predicting one quantity from another\n\t- Correlation can (but often does not, as we will see in some examples below) indicate the presence of a causal relationship\n\t- Correlation is used as a basic quantity and foundation for many other modeling techniques\n- Types:\n\t- Pearson’s Correlation: \n\t\t- Pearson is the most widely used correlation coefficient. Pearson correlation measures the linear association between continuous variables. In other words, this coefficient quantifies the degree to which a relationship between two variables can be described by a line. Raw observations are centered by subtracting their means and re-scaled by a measure of standard deviations.\n\t\t- `Ro_X,Y = E[(X - mu_X)(Y - mu_Y)] / simga_X sigma_Y `\n\t\t- numerator  -\u003e covariance\n\t\t- Dividing the covariance between two variables by the product of standard deviations ensures that correlation will always fall between -1 and 1 (much easier to interpret)\n\t- Spearman's Correlation:\n\t\t- Spearman's rank correlation coefficient can be defined as a special case of Pearson ρapplied to ranked (sorted) variables. Rather than comparing means and variances, Spearman's coefficient looks at the relative order of values for each variable. The formula for Spearman's coefficient looks very similar to that of Pearson, with the distinction of being computed on ranks instead of raw scores. \n\t- Kendall's Tau:\n\t\t- Also based on variable ranks, however, unlike Spearman's coefficient, Kendall’s tau does not take into account the difference between ranks— only directional agreement.\n- Covariance (matrix)\n\t- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Covariance\n\t- In probability theory and statistics, covariance is a measure of the joint variability of two random variables. The sign of the covariance therefore shows the tendency in the linear relationship between the variables. The magnitude of the covariance is not easy to interpret. The normalized version of the covariance, the correlation coefficient, however, shows by its magnitude the strength of the linear relation. \n\t- [In multidimensional case: covariance matrix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Covariance_matrix)\n- Correlation \u0026 Causation \n\t- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_does_not_imply_causation\n\t- \"Correlation does not imply causation\" is a phrase used in statistics to emphasize that a correlation between two variables does not imply that one causes the other. Spurious statistical associations can be found in a multitude of quantities, simply due to chance.\n\t- Often, a relationship may appear to be causal through high correlation due to some unobserved variables. For example, the number of grocery stores in a city can be strongly correlated with the number of ice cream creameries. However, there is an obvious hidden variable here— the population size of the city.\n\t- https://medium.com/@akelleh/a-technical-primer-on-causality-181db2575e41#.4csn3na8j\n\t- https://www.khanacademy.org/math/probability/scatterplots-a1/creating-interpreting-scatterplots/v/correlation-and-causality\n\t- Also, weak or no correlation does not imply lack of association. Correlation is only one data summary statistic that by no means tells the complete story of relationships in the data.\n\n\n### Experimental design\nSee [Active learning](AI/Active%20learning.md)\n- [Coursera - data scientist's toolbox](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vSXOJnGNtM4)\n- Good experiment: replication, measure variability, generalise to the problem, transparent\n- Confounding variable - strategies: randomization, stratifying \n- Prediction is not and inference. Both are important and depend on the problem. Prediction is more challenging that inference. For prediction there are key quantities (metrics): sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, accuracy\n\n#### A/B testing\n- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A/B_testing\n- In marketing and business intelligence, A/B testing is a term for a randomized experiment with two variants, A and B, which are the control and variation in the controlled experiment. A/B testing is a form of statistical hypothesis testing with two variants leading to the technical term, two-sample hypothesis testing, used in the field of statistics. Other terms used for this method include bucket tests and split-run testing.\n- https://www.optimizely.com/ab-testing/\n- https://www.wired.com/2012/04/ff_abtesting/\n- http://data36.com/ab-testing-5-rules/\n- https://www.udacity.com/course/ab-testing--ud257\n- https://tech.okcupid.com/the-pitfalls-of-a-b-testing-in-social-networks/\n- https://www.quora.com/What-kind-of-A-B-testing-questions-should-I-expect-in-a-data-scientist-interview-and-how-should-I-prepare-for-such-questions\n- http://www.kdnuggets.com/2017/05/must-know-key-issues-problems-ab-testing.html\n\n#### Multi-armed bandit\n- http://blog.actblue.com/2015/04/29/the-multi-armed-bandit-new-and-much-improved-ab-testing-tools-2/\n- https://conversionxl.com/bandit-tests/\n- https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/2844870?hl=en\n- https://vwo.com/blog/multi-armed-bandit-algorithm/\n\n### Statistical Inference\n- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_inference\n- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WkOinijQmPU\u0026feature=youtu.be\u0026list=PLpl-gQkQivXiBmGyzLrUjzsblmQsLtkzJ\n- https://leanpub.com/LittleInferenceBook/\n- Statistical inference : the process of generating conclusions about a population from a noisy sample. Without statistical inference we’re simply living within our data. With statistical inference, we’re trying to generate new knowledge. The use of probability models as the connection between our data and a populations represents the most effective way to obtain inference.\n- Question to answer: Are the statistics calculated on a small sample representative of the ones of the whole population?\n- http://www.datasciencecentral.com/profiles/blogs/the-death-of-the-statistical-test-of-hypothesis\n\n#### Frequentist inference\n- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequentist_inference\n- [Statistical Hypothesis testing](http://youtu.be/Wqvx6_12ZMs?list=PLpl-gQkQivXiBmGyzLrUjzsblmQsLtkzJ)\n\t- https://leanpub.com/LittleInferenceBook/read#leanpub-auto-hypothesis-testing\n\t- Hypothesis testing is concerned with making decisions using data. \n\t- To make decisions using data, we need to characterize the kinds of conclusions we can make. Classical hypothesis testing is concerned with deciding between two decisions (things get much harder if there’s more than two). The first, a null hypothesis is specified that represents the status quo. This hypothesis is usually labeled, H_0. This is what we assume by default. The alternative or research hypothesis is what we require evidence to conclude. This hypothesis is usually labeled H_a, or sometimes H_1 (or some other number other than 0). So to reiterate, the null hypothesis is assumed true and statistical evidence is required to reject it in favor of a research or alternative hypothesis\t\n\t- t-test\n\t\t- http://www.cs.cornell.edu/~asampson/blog/statsmistakes.html\n\t\t- https://www.quora.com/What-is-an-intuitive-explanation-of-the-t-test-in-hypothesis-testing\n\t\t- https://medium.freecodecamp.org/the-t-distribution-a-key-statistical-concept-discovered-by-a-beer-brewery-dbfdc693184\n\t- z-test\n\t- f-test\n- Confidence intervals\n\t- http://youtu.be/u85aQ0mtiZ8?list=PLpl-gQkQivXiBmGyzLrUjzsblmQsLtkzJ\n\t- https://leanpub.com/LittleInferenceBook/read#leanpub-auto-confidence-intervals\n\t- Confidence intervals are methods for quantifying uncertainty in our estimates. The fact that the interval has width characterizes that there is randomness that prevents us from getting a perfect estimate.\n\t- t-confidence intervals\n\t\t- http://youtu.be/pHXrDMjzyYg?list=PLpl-gQkQivXiBmGyzLrUjzsblmQsLtkzJ\n\t\t- https://leanpub.com/LittleInferenceBook/read#leanpub-auto-t-confidence-intervals\n- Null hypothesis\n\t- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Null_hypothesis\n\t- The term \"null hypothesis\" is a general statement or default position that there is no relationship between two measured phenomena, or no association among groups.\n\t- H_0 is generally assumed to be true until evidence indicates otherwise.\n- P-value\n\t- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P-value\n\t- A p-value is the probability that, using a given statistical model, the statistical summary (such as the sample mean difference between two compared groups) would be the same as or more extreme than the actual observed results, when the null hypothesis is true.\n\t- After choosing the models H_0, H_1 and a threshold value alpha for p (the significance level of the test, traditionally 5% or 1%), if the p-value is less than or equal to alpha, the test suggests that the observed data is inconsistent with the null hypothesis, so the null hypothesis must be rejected. However, that does not prove that the tested hypothesis is true. When the p-value is calculated correctly, this test guarantees that the Type I error rate is at most alpha. For typical analysis, using the standard alpha= 0.05 cutoff, the null hypothesis is rejected when p\u003c .05 and not rejected when p\u003e .05. \n\t- The p-value does not, in itself, support reasoning about the probabilities of hypotheses but is only a tool for deciding whether to reject the null hypothesis (it can only provide evidence against a hypothesis).\n\t- http://youtu.be/Ky68x_7iK6c?list=PLpl-gQkQivXiBmGyzLrUjzsblmQsLtkzJ\n\t- https://leanpub.com/LittleInferenceBook/read#leanpub-auto-p-values\n\t- P-values are the most common measure of statistical significance. Their ubiquity, along with concern over their interpretation and use makes them controversial among statisticians.\n\t- http://blog.minitab.com/blog/adventures-in-statistics-2/how-to-correctly-interpret-p-values\n\t- A P value is the probability of obtaining an effect at least as extreme as the one in your sample data, assuming the truth of the null hypothesis.\n\t- For example, suppose that a vaccine study produced a P value of 0.04. This P value indicates that if the vaccine had no effect, you’d obtain the observed difference or more in 4% of studies due to random sampling error. \n\t- P values address only one question: how likely are your data, assuming a true null hypothesis? It does not measure support for the alternative hypothesis.\n\t- http://machinelearningmastery.com/use-statistical-significance-tests-interpret-machine-learning-results/\n\t- https://www.nature.com/news/big-names-in-statistics-want-to-shake-up-much-maligned-p-value-1.22375\n- Statistical Power\n\t- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_power\n\t- #TALK Statistical power:\n\t\t- http://youtu.be/-TsBOLiW4rQ?list=PLpl-gQkQivXiB1mGyzLrUjzsblmQsLtkzJ\n\t\t- http://youtu.be/GRS2b1aedmk?list=PLpl-gQkQivXiBmGyzLrUjzsblmQsLtkzJ\n\t- https://leanpub.com/LittleInferenceBook/read#leanpub-auto-power\n\t- Power is the probability of rejecting the null hypothesis when it is false. Ergo, power (as its name would suggest) is a good thing; you want more power. A type II error (a bad thing, as its name would suggest) is failing to reject the null hypothesis when it’s false; the probability of a type II error is usually called Beta. Note Power = 1 - Beta.\n- [Effect size](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effect_size)\n- [Goodness of fit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goodness_of_fit)\n\t- [Chi squared](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chi-squared_test)\n\n### Bootstrap and permutation tests\n- http://youtu.be/0hNQx9nagq4?list=PLpl-gQkQivXiBmGyzLrUjzsblmQsLtkzJ\n- https://leanpub.com/LittleInferenceBook/read#leanpub-auto-the-bootstrap-and-resampling\n- The bootstrap is a tremendously useful tool for constructing confidence intervals and calculating standard errors for difficult statistics. That’s the bootstrap principle: investigate the sampling distribution of a statistic by simulating repeated realizations from the observed distribution.\n- https://leanpub.com/LittleInferenceBook/read#leanpub-auto-permutation-tests\n- Consider comparing means between the group. However, let’s use the calculate the distribution of our statistic under a null hypothesis that the labels are irrelevant (exchangeable). This is a handy way to create a null distribution for our test statistic by simply permuting the labels over and over and seeing how extreme our data are with respect to this permuted distribution. \n- The procedure would be as follows: \n\t- consider a data from with count and spray,\n\t- permute the spray (group) labels,\n\t- recalculate the statistic (such as the difference in means),\n\t- calculate the percentage of simulations where the simulated statistic was more extreme (toward the alternative) than the observed.\n\n#### Bayesian bootstrap\n- http://www.sumsar.net/blog/2015/04/the-non-parametric-bootstrap-as-a-bayesian-model/\n\n### Probability theory\nSee [Probability Theory](AI/Math%20and%20Statistics/Probability%20Theory.md)\n\n### Bayesian modelling\nSee [Bayesian modelling](AI/Bayesian%20modelling.md)\n\n### Monte Carlo methods\nSee [Monte Carlo methods](AI/Math%20and%20Statistics/Monte%20Carlo%20methods.md)\n\n### Mathematical Optimization\nSee [Mathematical Optimization](AI/Math%20and%20Statistics/Mathematical%20Optimization.md)\n\n### Time series analysis\nSee [Time Series analysis](Time%20Series%20analysis.md)\n\n### Regression analysis\nSee [Regression](AI/Supervised%20Learning/Regression.md)\n- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis\n- Regression analysis is widely used for prediction and forecasting, where its use has substantial overlap with the field of [Machine Learning](AI/Machine%20Learning.md)\n\n### Compressed sensing\n- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compressed_sensing\n- Compressed sensing(also known as compressive sensing, compressive sampling, or sparse sampling) is a signal processing technique for efficiently acquiring and reconstructing a signal, by finding solutions to underdetermined linear systems. This is based on the principle that, through optimization, the sparsity of a signal can be exploited to recover it from far fewer samples than required by the Shannon-Nyquist sampling theorem.\n- There are two conditions under which recovery is possible: \n\t- Sparsity, which requires the signal to be sparse in some domain. \n\t- Incoherence, which is applied through the isometric property which is sufficient for sparse signals\n- https://calculatedcontent.com/2012/12/28/foundations-theory-of-compressed-sensing/amp/\n\n#### Nyquist theorem\n- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nyquist%E2%80%93Shannon_sampling_theorem\n- In the field of digital signal processing, the sampling theorem is a fundamental bridge between continuous-time signals(often called \"analog signals\") and discrete-time signals(often called \"digital signals\"). It establishes a sufficient condition for a sample rate that permits a discrete sequence of samples to capture all the information from a continuous-time signal of finite bandwidth.\n\n#### Matching pursuit\n- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matching_pursuit\n- Matching pursuit (MP) is asparse approximation algorithm which involves finding the \"best matching\" projections of multidimensional data onto the span of an over-complete (i.e., redundant) dictionary D.\n- Orthogonal Matching Pursuit\n\t- Extension of MP: after every step, all the coefficients extracted so far are updated, by computing the orthogonal projection of the signal onto the set of atoms selected so far. This can lead to better results than standard MP, but requires more computation.\n\t- http://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/linear_model/plot_omp.html","lastmodified":"2022-03-31T08:22:26.958977122Z","tags":null},"/AI/Math-and-Statistics/Mathematical-Optimization":{"title":"Mathematical Optimization","content":"## Resources\n- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_optimization\n- [A birds-eye view of optimization algorithms (Pedregosa)](http://fa.bianp.net/teaching/2018/eecs227at/)\n- http://people.duke.edu/~ccc14/sta-663/BlackBoxOptimization.html\n- http://www.benfrederickson.com/numerical-optimization/ (notebook kind of post with python, d3)\n- http://www.kdnuggets.com/2016/12/hard-thing-about-deep-learning.html\n- https://www.neuraldesigner.com/blog/5_algorithms_to_train_a_neural_network\n- [Why Momentum works](http://distill.pub/2017/momentum/)\n\n### Heuristics\n- A heuristic is any algorithm which is not guaranteed (mathematically) to find the solution, but which is nevertheless useful in certain practical situations.\n- Genetic algorithms\n\t- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_algorithm\n\t- Metaheuristic inspired by the process of natural selection that belongs to the larger class of evolutionary algorithms(EA). Genetic algorithms are commonly used to generate high-quality solutions to optimization and search problems by relying on bio-inspired operators such as mutation, crossover and selection.\n- Nelder–Mead method\n\t- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nelder%E2%80%93Mead_method\n\t- The Nelder–Mead method or downhill simplex method or amoeba method is a commonly applied numerical method used to find the minimum or maximum of an objective function in a multidimensional space. It is applied to nonlinear optimization problems for which derivatives may not be known. However, the Nelder–Mead technique is a heuristic search method that can converge to non-stationary points on problems that can be solved by alternative methods.\n\t- The method uses the concept of a simplex, which is a special polytope of n+ 1 vertices in n dimensions. Examples of simplices include a line segment on a line, a triangle on a plane, a tetrahedron in three-dimensional space and so forth. The method approximates a local optimum of a problem with n variables when the objective function varies smoothly and is unimodal.\n\t- Nelder–Mead in n dimensions maintains a set of n+1test points arranged as a simplex. It then extrapolates the behavior of the objective function measured at each test point, in order to find a new test point and to replace one of the old test points with the new one, and so the technique progresses. The simplest approach is to replace the worst point with a point reflected through the centroid of the remaining n points. If this point is better than the best current point, then we can try stretching exponentially out along this line. On the other hand, if this new point isn't much better than the previous value, then we are stepping across a valley, so we shrink the simplex towards a better point.\n\n### Iterative methods\nThe iterative methods used to solve problems of nonlinear programming differ according to whether they evaluate Hessians, gradients, or only function values.\n- Gradient descent\n\t- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gradient_descent\n\t- Gradient descent is a first-order iterative optimization algorithm. To find a local minimum of a function using gradient descent, one takes steps proportional to the negative of the gradient (or of the approximate gradient) of the function at the current point. Gradient descent is also known as steepest descent, or the method of steepest descent.\n\t- [An overview of gradient descent optimization algorithms](http://ruder.io/optimizing-gradient-descent/index.html)\n\t- https://towardsdatascience.com/gradient-descent-demystified-bc30b26e432a\n\t- https://www.jeremyjordan.me/gradient-descent/\n- [Conjugate gradient method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conjugate_gradient_method)\n- [Interior point method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interior_point_method)\n\n\n## Code\n- #CODE [Nevergrad (Facebook) - A Python toolbox for performing gradient-free optimization](https://code.fb.com/ai-research/nevergrad/)\n- #CODE [scikit-optimize](https://scikit-optimize.github.io/)\n- #CODE [GPflowOpt - library for Bayesian Optimization with GPflow](https://gpflowopt.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html )\n- #CODE [JAX](https://github.com/google/jax) ^jax\n\t- JAX is Autograd and XLA, brought together for high-performance machine learning research.

The filtering problem consists of estimating the internal states in dynamical systems when partial observations are made, and random perturbations are present in the sensors as well as in the dynamical system. The objective is to compute the posterior distributions of the states of some Markov process, given some noisy and partial observations.\n\n### Markov Process\n- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_chain\n- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_property\n- A stochastic process has the Markov property if the conditional probability distribution of future states of the process (conditional on both past and present states) depends only upon the present state, not on the sequence of events that preceded it.

The random variables that we study will come in two varieties, discrete or continuous. Discrete random variables are random variables that take on only a countable number of possibilities. Mass functions will assign probabilities that they take specific values. Continuous random variable can conceptually take any value on the real line or some subset of the real line and we talk about the probability that they lie within some range. Densities will characterize these probabilities.\n- For all of these kinds of random variables, we need convenient mathematical functions to model the probabilities of collections of realizations. These functions, called mass functions and densities, take possible values of the random variables, and assign the associated probabilities. These entities describe the population of interest.\n- PDF - probability density function\n\t- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability_density_function\n\t- http://youtu.be/mPe0Us4VYDM?list=PLpl-gQkQivXiBmGyzLrUjzsblmQsLtkzJ\n\t- https://leanpub.com/LittleInferenceBook/read#leanpub-auto-probability-density-functions\n\t- A probability density function (pdf), is a function associated with a continuous random variable. Because of the peculiarities of treating measurements as having been recorded to infinite decimal expansions, we need a different set of rules. This leads us to the central dogma of probability density functions: Areas under PDFs correspond to probabilities for that random variable. \n\t- A PDF, or density of a continuous random variable, is a function, whose value at any given sample (or point) in the sample space(the set of possible values taken by the random variable) can be interpreted as providing a relative likelihood that the value of the random variable would equal that sample.\n\t- The PDF is used to specify the probability of the random variable falling within a particular range of values, as opposed to taking on any one value.\n\n#### Conditional probability\n- http://youtu.be/u6AH6qsSVA4?list=PLpl-gQkQivXiBmGyzLrUjzsblmQsLtkzJ\n- https://leanpub.com/LittleInferenceBook/read#leanpub-auto-conditional-probability\n- Conditioning is a central subject in statistics. If we are given information about a random variable, it changes the probabilities associated with it. For example, the probability of getting a one when rolling a (standard) die is usually assumed to be one sixth. If you were given the extra information that the die roll was an odd number (hence 1, 3 or 5) then conditional on this new information, the probability of a one is now one third.\n- http://setosa.io/ev/conditional-probability/\n\n#### Independance\n- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independence_(probability_theory)\n- http://youtu.be/MY1EfrR1ZUs?list=PLpl-gQkQivXiBmGyzLrUjzsblmQsLtkzJ\n- https://leanpub.com/LittleInferenceBook/read#leanpub-auto-independence\n- Statistical independence of events is the idea that the events are unrelated. Consider successive coin flips. Knowledge of the result of the first coin flip tells us nothing about the second.\n- The important principle is that probabilities of independent things multiply! This has numerous consequences, including the idea that we shouldn’t multiply non-independent probabilities.\n- [IID samples ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_and_identically_distributed_random_variables)\n\t- IID - Independent and identically distributed \n\t- In probability theory and statistics, a sequence or other collection of random variables is independent and identically distributed(i.i.d.) if each random variable has the same probability distribution as the others and all are mutually independent.\n\t- https://leanpub.com/LittleInferenceBook/read#leanpub-auto-iid-random-variables\n\t- Random variables are said to be independent and identically distributed (iid) if they are independent and all are drawn from the same population. The reason iid samples are so important is that they are a model for random samples. This is a default starting point for most statistical inferences.\n  \n#### Common distributions\n- https://stanford.edu/~shervine/teaching/cme-106/distribution-tables\n- https://blog.cloudera.com/blog/2015/12/common-probability-distributions-the-data-scientists-crib-sheet/\n- https://leanpub.com/LittleInferenceBook/read#leanpub-auto-some-common-distributions\n- [Normal distribution](http://efavdb.com/normal-distributions/)\n- Bernoulli\n\t- https://leanpub.com/LittleInferenceBook/read#leanpub-auto-the-bernoulli-distribution\n\t- TheBernoulli distribution arises as the result of a binary outcome, such as a coin flip.\n- Normal\n\t- http://youtu.be/dUTWvKa0Leo?list=PLpl-gQkQivXiBmGyzLrUjzsblmQsLtkzJ\n\t- https://leanpub.com/LittleInferenceBook/read#leanpub-auto-the-normal-distribution\n\t- The normal distribution is easily the handiest distribution in all of statistics.

It is perhaps only second to the normal distribution usefulness. In fact, the Bernoulli, binomial and multinomial distributions can all be modeled by clever uses of the Poisson.\n\t- The Poisson distribution is especially useful for modeling unbounded counts or counts per unit of time (rates). Like the number of clicks on advertisements, or the number of people who show up at a bus stop. There is also a deep connection between the Poisson distribution and popular models for so-called event-time data.\n\n#### Expected value\n- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expected_value\n- In probability theory, the expected value of a random variable, intuitively, is the long-run average value of repetitions of the experiment it represents.\n- Less roughly, the law of large numbers states that the arithmetic mean of the values almost surely converges to the expected value as the number of repetitions approaches infinity. The expected value is also known as the expectation, mathematical expectation, EV, average, mean value, mean, or first moment.\n- [Expected values](http://youtu.be/zljxRbu6jyc?list=PLpl-gQkQivXiBmGyzLrUjzsblmQsLtkzJ)\n- https://leanpub.com/LittleInferenceBook/read#leanpub-auto-expected-values\n- Expected values characterize a distribution. The most useful expected value, the mean, characterizes the center of a density or mass function. Another expected value summary, the variance, characterizes how spread out a density is. Yet another expected value calculation is the skewness, which considers how much a density is pulled toward high or low values.\n\n#### Central limit theorem\n- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_limit_theorem\n- http://youtu.be/FAIyVHmniK0?list=PLpl-gQkQivXiBmGyzLrUjzsblmQsLtkzJ\n- https://leanpub.com/LittleInferenceBook/read#leanpub-auto-the-central-limit-theorem\n- CLT is one of the most important theorems in statistics. For our purposes, the CLT states that the distribution of averages of iid variables becomes that of a standard normal as the sample size increases.\n\n#### Kullback-Leibler Divergence\n- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kullback%E2%80%93Leibler_divergence\n- https://www.countbayesie.com/blog/2017/5/9/kullback-leibler-divergence-explained\n\n\n## Books\n- #COURSE [Introduction to Probability and Statistics (MIT)](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/mathematics/18-05-introduction-to-probability-and-statistics-spring-2014/)","lastmodified":"2022-03-31T08:22:26.958977122Z","tags":null},"/AI/NLP":{"title":"Natural Language Processing (NLP)","content":"---\n\n## Resources\n- NLP is a branch of data science that consists of systematic processes for analyzing, understanding, and deriving information from the text data in a smart and efficient manner.

The interesting difference between supervised and reinforcement learning is that this reward signal simply tells you whether the action (or input) that the agent takes is good or bad. It doesn’t tell you anything about what the best action is. Contrast this to CNNs where the corresponding label for each image input is a definite instruction of what the output should be for each input.  Another unique component of RL is that an agent’s actions will affect the subsequent data it receives. For example, an agent’s action of moving left instead of right means that the agent will receive different input from the environment at the next time step.\n- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reinforcement_learning\n- [Curriculum for Reinforcement Learning](https://lilianweng.github.io/lil-log/2020/01/29/curriculum-for-reinforcement-learning.html)\n- [Andrej Karpathy's introduction to RL](http://karpathy.github.io/2016/05/31/rl/)\n- [Evolution strategies vs RL](https://blog.openai.com/evolution-strategies/)\n\t- https://github.com/openai/evolution-strategies-starter\n- [Reinforcement learning derivations (math)](http://www.alexirpan.com/rl-derivations/)\n- [Introduction to various RL algos](https://towardsdatascience.com/introduction-to-various-reinforcement-learning-algorithms-i-q-learning-sarsa-dqn-ddpg-72a5e0cb6287)\n- [Q-learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Q-learning)\n- Temporal differencing (TD) learning  is a prediction-based machine learning method. \n\t- It has primarily been used for the reinforcement learning problem, and is said to be \"a combination ofMonte Carlo ideas and dynamic programming (DP) ideas.\" \n\t- TD resembles a Monte Carlo method because it learns by sampling the environment according to some policy, and is related to dynamic programming techniques as it approximates its current estimate based on previously learned estimates (a process known as bootstrapping). The TD learning algorithm is related to the temporal difference model of animal learning. As a prediction method, TD learning considers that subsequent predictions are often correlated in some sense.\n\t- TD-Lambda: This algorithm was famously applied by Gerald Tesauro to createTD-Gammon, a program that learned to play the game of backgammon at the level of expert human players. The lambda parameter refers to the trace decay parameter, with 0\u003c= lambda \u003c=1. Higher settings lead to longer lasting traces; that is, a larger proportion of credit from a reward can be given to more distant states and actions when lambda is higher, with lambda=1 producing parallel learning to Monte Carlo RL algorithms.\n- [SARSA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State%E2%80%93action%E2%80%93reward%E2%80%93state%E2%80%93action)\n\n\n## Courses, talks and books\n- #COURSE [Reinforcement Learning (UCL)](https://www.davidsilver.uk/teaching/)\n\t- [Videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2pWv7GOvuf0\u0026list=PLzuuYNsE1EZAXYR4FJ75jcJseBmo4KQ9-)\n- #COURSE [CS294-112 Deep Reinforcement Learning Sp17](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLkFD6_40KJIwTmSbCv9OVJB3YaO4sFwkX)\n- #COURSE [Practical Reinforcement Learning (Yandex)](https://github.com/yandexdataschool/Practical_RL)\n- #COURSE [Tutorial: Introduction to Reinforcement Learning](https://colab.research.google.com/github/NeuromatchAcademy/course-content-dl/blob/main/tutorials/W3D2_BasicReinforcementLearning/student/W3D2_Tutorial1.ipynb)\n- #TALK [Deep Learning and Reinforcement Learning Summer School, Toronto 2018](http://videolectures.net/DLRLsummerschool2018_toronto/)\n- #TALK [Deep RL Bootcamp](https://sites.google.com/view/deep-rl-bootcamp/lectures\t  )\n- #BOOK [Deep Reinforcement Learning (2020 SPRINGER)](https://www.springer.com/gp/book/9789811540943)\n\t- https://deepreinforcementlearningbook.org/\n\n\n## Code\n- #CODE [Acme: a research framework for reinforcement learning](https://github.com/deepmind/acme)\n- #CODE [Deep Reinforcement Learning Model ZOO](https://github.com/tensorlayer/tensorlayer/tree/master/examples/reinforcement_learning)\n- #CODE [Open.ai Gym - A toolkit for developing and comparing reinforcement learning algorithms](https://github.com/openai/gym)\n\t- https://gym.openai.com/\n\t- #PAPER http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.01540\n- #CODE [Horizon (Facebook) - The first open source reinforcement learning platform for large-scale products and services](https://github.com/facebookresearch/Horizon)\n- #CODE [Keras-rl - Deep Reinforcement Learning for Keras](https://github.com/keras-rl/keras-rl)\n- #CODE [TRFL (pronounced \"truffle\") is a library built on top of TensorFlow that exposes several useful building blocks for implementing Reinforcement Learning agents](https://github.com/deepmind/trfl/)\n- #CODE [Surreal - Open-Source Distributed Reinforcement Learning Framework by Stanford Vision and Learning Lab](https://github.com/SurrealAI/surreal)\n\t- https://surreal.stanford.edu\n- #CODE Tensorforce - Tensorforce is an open-source deep reinforcement learning framework, with an emphasis on modularized flexible library design and straightforward usability for applications in research and practice. \n\t- https://github.com/tensorforce/tensorforce\n\t- https://reinforce.io/blog/introduction-to-tensorforce/\n- #CODE [Tensorlayer](https://github.com/tensorlayer/tensorlayer)\n\t- Deep Learning and Reinforcement Learning Library for Scientists and Engineers\n\t- https://tensorlayer.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html\n\n\n## References\n### Deep RL\n- [Spinning Up as a Deep RL Researcher](https://spinningup.openai.com/en/latest/spinningup/spinningup.html)\n\nReview papers:\n- #PAPER [A Brief Survey of Deep Reinforcement Learning (Arulkumaran 2017)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.05866)\n\t- Many of the successes in DRL have been based on scaling up prior work in RL to high-dimensional problems.

The most common technique is known as SMOTE. \n\t- https://machinelearningmastery.com/smote-oversampling-for-imbalanced-classification/\n- #PAPER [ADASYN: Adaptive synthetic sampling approach for imbalanced learning (He 2008)](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4633969)\n\t- https://sci2s.ugr.es/keel/pdf/algorithm/congreso/2008-He-ieee.pdf\n\t- ADASYN builds on the methodology of SMOTE, by shifting the importance of the classification boundary to those minority classes which are difficult. ADASYN uses a weighted distribution for different minority class examples according to their level of difficulty in learning, where more synthetic data is generated for minority class examples that are harder to learn.\n\n#### Undersampling\n- Down-sampling involves randomly removing observations from the majority class to prevent its signal from dominating the learning algorithm. The most common heuristic for doing so is resampling without replacement.\n- https://machinelearningmastery.com/undersampling-algorithms-for-imbalanced-classification/\n- Cluster. Cluster centroids is a method that replaces cluster of samples by the cluster centroid of a K-means algorithm, where the number of clusters is set by the level of undersampling.\n- Tomek links. Tomek links remove unwanted overlap between classes where majority class links are removed until all minimally distanced nearest neighbor pairs are of the same class. Tomek links are pairs of instances of opposite classes who are their own nearest neighbors. Tomek’s algorithm looks for such pairs and removes the majority instance of the pair.\n\t- [Classification of Imbalance Data using Tomek Link (T-Link) Combined with Random Under-sampling (RUS) as a Data Reduction Method](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/6ec4/18f9071f3a96d5548e87e34be3665703119e.pdf)\n- Throw away minority examples and switch to an anomaly detection framework\n\n### Adjust the class importance or the metric\n- At the algorithm level, or after: Adjust the class weight (misclassification costs), adjust the decision threshold. Many machine learning toolkits have ways to adjust the “importance” of classes (classifiers that take an optional class_weight). \n- Change the metric. \n\t- Evaluating the classifier: Accuracy is not a good metric for imbalanced classes!!\n\t- Use a ROC curve\n\t- Don’t get hard classifications (labels) from your classifier (via score or predict). Instead, get probability estimates via proba or predict_proba\n\t- No matter what you do for training, always test on the natural (stratified) distribution your classifier is going to operate upon.

For this tactic we use penalized learning algorithms that increase the cost of classification mistakes on the minority class. A popular algorithm for this technique is Penalized-SVM. During training, we can use the argument class_weight='balanced'  to penalize mistakes on the minority class by an amount proportional to how under-represented it is.\n\n### Select or create a suitable algorithm\n- Create new algorithm for the imbalanced classes situation, or use one which handles the data imbalance\n- #PAPER [Boosting/bagging.

L1/LASSO penalties drive unnecessary regression parameters to zero, selecting a small, representative subset of regression parameters for the regression model while avoiding potential multiple comparison problems that arise in forward, backward, and stepwise variable selection. Tikhonov/L2/ridge penalties help preserve parameter estimate stability, even when many correlated variables exist in a wide data set or important predictor variables are correlated. It’s also important to know penalized regression techniques don’t always create confidence intervals, t-statistics, or p-values for regression parameters. These types of measures are typically only available through iterative methods or bootstrapping that can require extra computing time.\n\t- https://www.quora.com/What-is-regularization-in-machine-learning\n\t- The loss function is penalized by adding an L1 or L2 norm of the weights vector W (the vector of the learned parameters in the linear regression):\n\t\t- L(X,Y) + lambda N(W), where N is either the L1, L2 or any other norm.\n\t\t- This helps avoiding overfitting and performs fetuses selection for the case of the L1 regularization.

In contrast, boosting is an approach to increase the complexity of models that suffer from high bias, that is, models that underfit the training data\n- https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/ensemble.html#random-forests\n- http://www.listendata.com/2014/11/random-forest-with-r.html\n- https://medium.com/rants-on-machine-learning/the-unreasonable-effectiveness-of-random-forests-f33c3ce28883\n- In particular, trees that are grown very deep tend to learn highly irregular patterns: they overfit their training set or have low bias, but very high variance. Random forests are a way of averaging multiple deep decision trees, trained on different parts of the same training set, with the goal of reducing the variance. This comes at the expense of a small increase in the bias and some loss of interpretability, but generally greatly boosts the performance of the final model.\n\n\n## References\n- #THESIS/PHD [Understanding Random Forests: From Theory to Practice (Louppe 2014)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1407.7502)","lastmodified":"2022-03-31T08:22:26.958977122Z","tags":null},"/AI/Supervised-Learning/Regression":{"title":"Regression","content":"---\n\nSee: \n- [Time Series analysis](AI/Time%20Series%20analysis.md)\n- [RNNs](AI/Deep%20learning/RNNs.md)\n- \"Sequence time series modelling\" section in [CNNs](AI/Deep%20learning/CNNs.md)\n\n\n## Resources\n- https://www.analytics. idhya.com/blog/2015/08/comprehensive-guide-regression/\n- https://towardsdatascience.com/a-beginners-guide-to-regression-analysis-in-machine-learning-8a828b491bbf\n- http://www.datasciencecentral.com/profiles/blogs/10-types-of-regressions-which-one-to-use\n- http://www.datasciencecentral.com/profiles/blogs/23-types-of-regression\n- [Curve fitting vs regression](https://blog.datazar.com/curve-fitting-vs-regression-752ce295b0b1)\n- Goodness of fit:\n\t- [Coefficient of determination (The R-squared measure of goodness of fit)](http://blog.minitab.com/blog/adventures-in-statistics-2/regression-analysis-how-do-i-interpret-r-squared-and-assess-the-goodness-of-fit)\n\t- Reduced chi-squared\n- [Linear models](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/linear_model.html)\n\n\n### Linear Regression\n- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_regression\n- In statistics, linear regression is an approach for modeling the relationship between a scalar dependent variable y and one or more explanatory variables (or independent variables) denoted X.

For instance, a well calibrated (binary) classifier should classify the samples such that among the samples to which it gave a predict_proba value close to 0.8, approximately 80% actually belong to the positive class.\n- https://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/calibration/plot_compare_calibration.html\n- Isotonic regression: \n\t- https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/isotonic.html\n\t- Isotonic regression is a probability calibration technique which can calibrate classifier scores to approximate probability values by fitting a stepwise non-decreasing function along the scores returned by the classifier.","lastmodified":"2022-03-31T08:22:26.958977122Z","tags":null},"/AI/Time-Series-analysis":{"title":"Time series analysis","content":"See: \n- [Forecasting](AI/Forecasting.md)\n- [RNNs](AI/Deep%20learning/RNNs.md)\n- \"Sequence (time series) modelling\" section in [CNNs](AI/Deep%20learning/CNNs.md)\n- \"Deep learning for tabular data\" section in [DL](AI/Deep%20learning/DL.md)\n\n## Resources\n- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_series\n- https://github.com/MaxBenChrist/awesome_time_series_in_python\n- https://github.com/frutik/awesome-timeseries\n- https://github.com/cuge1995/awesome-time-series\n- http://machinelearningmastery.com/convert-time-series-supervised-learning-problem-python/\n- [Python to work with time series data](https://github.com/MaxBenChrist/awesome_time_series_in_python)\n- [timeseriesAI](https://github.com/timeseriesAI)\n\n## Code\nSee code in [Forecasting](AI/Forecasting.md)\n\n- #CODE [Orbit](https://github.com/uber/orbit)\n\t- A Python package for Bayesian forecasting with object-oriented design and probabilistic models under the hood.\n\t- https://eng.uber.com/the-new-version-of-orbit-v1-1-is-released/\n- #CODE [TSflex](https://github.com/predict-idlab/tsflex)\n\t- https://predict-idlab.github.io/tsflex/\n- #CODE [Merlion](https://github.com/salesforce/merlion)\n\t- #PAPER [Merlion: A Machine Learning Library for Time Series (Bhatnagar 2021)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.09265)\n\t- Merlion is a Python library for time series intelligence\n- #CODE [Kats](https://github.com/facebookresearch/Kats) ^kats\n\t- Kats, a kit to analyze time series data, a lightweight, easy-to-use, generalizable, and extendable framework to perform time series analysis, from understanding the key statistics and characteristics, detecting change points and anomalies, to forecasting future trends\n\t- https://facebookresearch.github.io/Kats/\n\t- https://engineering.fb.com/2021/06/21/open-source/kats/\n\t- https://towardsdatascience.com/kats-a-generalizable-framework-to-analyze-time-series-data-in-python-3c8d21efe057\n- #CODE [Sktime](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime)\n\t- https://towardsdatascience.com/sktime-a-unified-python-library-for-time-series-machine-learning-3c103c139a55\n- #CODE [Tsfresh - Time Series Feature extraction based on scalable hypothesis tests](https://github.com/blue-yonder/tsfresh)\n\t- [Automatic extraction of relevant features from time series](http://tsfresh.readthedocs.io)\n- #CODE [TSFEL](https://github.com/fraunhoferportugal/tsfel)\n\t- #PAPER [TSFEL: Time Series Feature Extraction Library (Barandas 2020)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352711020300017)\n- #CODE [Tslearn - A machine learning toolkit dedicated to time-series data](https://github.com/rtavenar/tslearn)\n- #CODE [Pmdarima](https://github.com/alkaline-ml/pmdarima)\n\t- Pyramid bridges one more gap between R and Python by bringing R's auto.arima to Python.

Strategies for hierarchical clustering generally fall into two types:\n\t- Agglomerative: This is a \"bottom up\" approach: each observation starts in its own cluster, and pairs of clusters are merged as one moves up the hierarchy.\n\t- Divisive: This is a \"top down\" approach: all observations start in one cluster, and splits are performed recursively as one moves down the hierarchy.\n\t- The results of hierarchical clustering are usually presented in a dendrogram. The complexity of agglomerative clustering is O(n^2log(n)), slow for large data.

It is based on grouping clusters in bottom-up fashion (agglomerative clustering), at each step combining two clusters that contain the closest pair of elements not yet belonging to the same cluster as each other. A drawback of this method is that it tends to produce long thin clusters in which nearby elements of the same cluster have small distances, but elements at opposite ends of a cluster may be much farther from each other than to elements of other clusters. The naive version has a time complexity of O(n^3). There are improvements: SLINK and Kruskal's algo, with time complexity O(n^2).\n\t- Mean linkage\n\t\t- [Unweighted Pair Group Method with Arithmetic Mean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UPGMA)\n\t    - [Weighted Pair Group Method with Arithmetic Mean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WPGMA)\n\t- Ward’s method: Ward's minimum variance criterion minimizes the total within-cluster variance.\n\t  To implement this method, at each step find the pair of clusters that leads to minimum increase in total within-cluster variance after merging. This increase is a weighted squared distance between cluster centers. At the initial step, all clusters are singletons (clusters containing a single point).\n\t- Complete linkage: The method is also known as farthest neighbour clustering. At the beginning of the process, each element is in a cluster of its own. The clusters are then sequentially combined into larger clusters until all elements end up being in the same cluster. At each step, the two clusters separated by the shortest distance are combined. \n\t  The definition of 'shortest distance' is what differentiates between the different agglomerative clustering methods. \n\t  In complete-linkage clustering, the link between two clusters contains all element pairs, and the distance between clusters equals the distance between those two elements (one in each cluster) that are farthest away from each other. Complexity O(n^3), CLINK version with O(n^2).\n- [K-means](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-means_clustering)\n\t- k-means clustering aims to partition n observations into k clusters in which each observation belongs to the cluster with the nearest mean, serving as a prototype of the cluster.

Often, the data is transformed to two-dimensional space and visualized as a scatter plot as a means to analyze and understand the data\n- Two categories: linear and non-linear projection techniques. \n\n### Linear methods\n- Linear projection techniques produce a linear transformation of data dimensions in lower-dimensional space. Proximity between data points indicates similarity. The more similar data points are, the closer they are located to each other and vice versa. This is why linear projection techniques are also known as global techniques.\n\n#### Principal component analysis (PCA)\n- Principal component analysis(PCA) is a statistical procedure that uses an orthogonal transformation to convert a set of observations of possibly correlated variables into a set of values of linearly uncorrelated variables called principal components. The number of principal components is less than or equal to the number of original variables. This transformation is defined in such a way that the first principal component has the largest possible variance(that is, accounts for as much of the variability in the data as possible), and each succeeding component in turn has the highest variance possible under the constraint that it is orthogonal to the preceding components. The resulting vectors are an uncorrelated orthogonal basis set.\n- http://setosa.io/ev/principal-component-analysis/\n- https://www.neuraldesigner.com/blog/principal-components-analysis\n- #PAPER [EigenGame: PCA as a Nash Equilibrium (Gemp 2021)](https://openreview.net/forum?id=NzTU59SYbNq)\n\t- https://pub.towardsai.net/deepmind-wants-to-reimagine-one-of-the-most-important-algorithms-in-machine-learning-381884d42de\n\n#### Non-negative matrix factorization (NMF)\n- Non-negative matrix factorization (NNMF, or NMF) is a method for factorizing a matrix into two lower rank matrices with strictly non-negative elements.\n- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-negative_matrix_factorization\n- https://yliapis.github.io/Non-Negative-Matrix-Factorization/\n- https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.decomposition.NMF.html\n- https://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/decomposition/plot_faces_decomposition.html#sphx-glr-auto-examples-decomposition-plot-faces-decomposition-py\n\n#### Generalized Low Rank Models\n- Extension of the idea of PCA to handle arbitrary data sets consisting of numerical, Boolean, categorical, ordinal, and other data types.

The technique can be implemented via Barnes-Hut approximations, allowing it to be applied on large real-world datasets. It is particularly well-suited for embedding high-dimensional data into a space of two or three dimensions, which can then be visualized in a scatter plot. Specifically, it models each high-dimensional object by a two- or three-dimensional point in such a way that similar objects are modeled by nearby points and dissimilar objects are modeled by distant points.\n- https://mark-borg.github.io/blog/2016/tsne/\n- https://blog.alookanalytics.com/2017/02/28/analytical-market-segmentation-with-t-sne-and-clustering-pipeline/\n- [How to Use t-SNE Effectively (Interactive)](http://distill.pub/2016/misread-tsne/)\n\n#### Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP)\n- #PAPER [UMAP - Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection for Dimension Reduction (McInnes 2020)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.03426)","lastmodified":"2022-03-31T08:22:26.958977122Z","tags":null},"/AI/Unsupervised-learning/Unsupervised-learning":{"title":"Unsupervised learning","content":"## Resources\n- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unsupervised_learning\n- [Unsupervised Learning cheatsheet](https://stanford.edu/~shervine/teaching/cs-229/cheatsheet-unsupervised-learning)\n- Unsupervised machine learning is the machine learning task of inferring a function to describe hidden structure from \"unlabeled\" data (a classification or categorization is not included in the observations).\n\n## Sub-topics\n### Kernel density estimation\n- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kernel_density_estimation\n- kernel density estimation (KDE) is a non-parametric way to estimate the probability density function of a random variable\n- https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/density.html\n- https://stackabuse.com/kernel-density-estimation-in-python-using-scikit-learn/\n\n### Dimensionality reduction and low rank modeling\nSee [Dimensionality reduction and low rank modeling](AI/Unsupervised%20learning/Dimensionality%20reduction%20and%20low%20rank%20modeling.md)\n\n### Clustering \nSee [Clustering](AI/Unsupervised%20learning/Clustering.md)\n\n### Blind source separation\n- Blind signal separation (BSS), also known as blind source separation, is the separation of a set of source signals from a set of mixed signals, without the aid of information (or with very little information) about the source signals or the mixing process.\n\n#### Independent component analysis (ICA)\n- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_component_analysis\n- In signal processing, independent component analysis (ICA) is a computational method for separating a multivariate signal into additive subcomponents.

This approach alleviates the burden of obtaining hand-labeled data sets, which can be costly or impractical. Instead, inexpensive weak labels are employed with the understanding that they are imperfect, but can nonetheless be used to create a strong predictive model.\n- Other areas of machine learning exist that are likewise motivated by the demand for increased quantity and quality of labeled training data but employ different high-level techniques to approach this demand. These other approaches include [active learning](AI/Active%20learning.md), [semi-supervised learning](AI/Semi-supervised%20learning.md), and [transfer learning](AI/Transfer%20learning.md).\n- Related to [One, few-shot learning](AI/One,%20few-shot%20learning.md). The most relevant problem to few-shot learning is weakly supervised learning with incomplete supervision where only a small amount of samples have supervised. By definition, weakly supervised learning with incomplete supervision includes only classification and regression, while few-shot learning also includes reinforcement learning problems. Moreover, weakly supervised learning with incomplete supervision mainly uses unlabeled data as additional information in E, while few-shot learning leverages various kinds of prior knowledge such as pretrained models, supervised data from other domains or modalities and does not restrict to using unlabeled data. Therefore, few-shot learning becomes weakly supervised learning problem only when prior knowledge is unlabeled data and the task is classification or regression.information.\n- [Weakly Supervised Learning: Introduction and Best Practices](https://datasciencemilan.medium.com/weakly-supervised-learning-introduction-and-best-practices-c65f490d4a0a)\n\n\n## References\n- #PAPER [A brief introduction to weakly supervised learning (2018)](https://academic.oup.com/nsr/article/5/1/44/4093912 )\n- #PAPER [A Graph-Based Method for Active Outlier Detection With Limited Expert Feedback (2019)](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8871105)\n\n### Incomplete supervision\n- In this case, only a (usually small) subset of training data is given with labels while the other data remain unlabeled (e.g., in image categorization the ground-truth labels are given by human annotators, and only a small subset of images can be annotated due to the human cost)\n- #PAPER [Learning from Incomplete and Inaccurate Supervision (Zhang 2021)](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9361098)\n\n### Inexact supervision\n- In this case, only coarse-grained labels are given.

Impurity is quantified by the splitting criterion of the decision trees (Gini, Entropy or Mean Squared Error). However, this method can give high importance to features that may not be predictive on unseen data when the model is overfitting. Permutation-based feature importance, on the other hand, avoids this issue, since it can be computed on unseen data\n\n#### Surrogate models\n- A surrogate model is a simple model that is used to explain a complex model. Surrogate models are usually created by training a linear regression or decision tree on the original inputs and predictions of a complex model. Coefficients, variable importance, trends, and interactions displayed in the surrogate model are then assumed to be indicative of the internal mechanisms of the complex model. There are few, possibly no, theoretical guarantees that the simple surrogate model is highly representative of the more complex model.\n- The globally interpretable attributes of a simple model are used to explain global attributes of a more complex model. However, there is nothing to preclude fitting surrogate models to more local regions of a complex model's conditional distribution, such as clusters of input records and their corresponding predictions and their corresponding input rows. Because small sections of the conditional distribution are more likely to be linear, monotonic, or otherwise well-behaved, local surrogate models can be more accurate than global surrogate models.\n- #PAPER [LIME - \"Why Should I Trust You?\": Explaining the Predictions of Any Classifier (2016)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1602.04938) ^lime\n\t- #CODE See [Code](#Code) section\n\t- Formalized approach for local surrogate models.

For the purposes of maximum activation analysis, low residuals for a certain tree are analogous to high-magnitude neuron output in a neural network.\n- Maximum activation analysis elucidates internal mechanisms of complex models by determining the parts of the response function that specific observations or groups of similar observations excite to the highest degree, either by high-magnitude output from neurons or by low residual output from trees.\n\n\n### Sensitivity analysis\n- See [Neural Networks explainability](#Neural%20Networks%20explainability)\n- Sensitivity analysis investigates whether model behavior and outputs remain stable when data is intentionally perturbed or other changes are simulated in data. \n- Beyond traditional assessment practices, sensitivity analysis of machine learning model predictions is perhaps the most important validation technique for machine learning models. \n- Machine learning models can make drastically differing predictions from minor changes in input variable values. In practice, many linear model validation techniques focus on the numerical instability of regression parameters due to correlation between input variables or between input variables and the dependent variable\n- Sensitivity analysis can also test model behavior and outputs when interesting situations or known corner cases are simulated. Output distributions, error measurements, plots, and interpretation techniques can be used to explore the way models behave in important scenarios, how they change over time, or if models remain stable when data is subtly and intentionally corrupted\n\n\n### Variable importance measures\n- Variable importance measures are typically seen in tree-based models but are sometimes also reported for other models.\n- A simple heuristic rule for variable importance in a decision tree is related to the depth and frequency at which a variable is split on in a tree, where variables used higher in the tree and more frequently in the tree are more important. \n- For a single decision tree, a variable's importance is quantitatively determined by the cumulative change in the splitting criterion for every node in which that variable was chosen as the best splitting candidate. \n- For a gradient boosted tree ensemble, variable importance is calculated as it is for a single tree but aggregated for the ensemble. \n- For random forests:\n\t- Variable importance is also calculated as it is for a single tree and aggregated, but an additional measure of variable importance is provided by the change in out-of-bag accuracy caused by shuffling the independent variable of interest, where larger decreases in accuracy are taken as larger indications of importance\n\t- The default method to compute variable importance is the mean decrease in impurity (or gini importance) mechanism: At each split in each tree, the improvement in the split-criterion is the importance measure attributed to the splitting variable, and is accumulated over all the trees in the forest separately for each variable. Note that this measure is quite like the R^2 in regression on the training set\n\t- [This example highlights the limitations of impurity-based feature importance in contrast to permutation-based feature importance](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/inspection/plot_permutation_importance.html)\n\t- #PAPER [Understanding variable importances in forests of randomized trees (Louppe 2013)](https://papers.nips.cc/paper/4928-understanding-variable-importances-in-forests-of-randomized-trees.pdf)\n\t\t- #POSTER https://orbi.uliege.be/bitstream/2268/155642/3/poster.pdf\n\t- #PAPER [Trees, forests, and impurity-based variable importance (Scornet 2020)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.04295)\n- For neural networks, variable importance measures are typically associated with the aggregated, absolute magnitude of model parameters for a given variable of interest. \n- Global variable importance techniques are typically model specific, and practitioners should be aware that unsophisticated measures of variable importance can be biased toward larger scale variables or variables with a high number of categories.\n\n\n### Neural Networks explainability\nSee [Code](#Code) section\n\n#### Resources \n- [Using ML to Explore Neural Network Architecture](https://research.googleblog.com/2017/05/using-machine-learning-to-explore.html)\n- [The Building Blocks of Interpretability](https://distill.pub/2018/building-blocks/)\n- [Feature Visualization](https://distill.pub/2017/feature-visualization/)\n- [Applying deep learning to real-world problems (labeled data, imbalance, black box models)](https://medium.com/merantix/applying-deep-learning-to-real-world-problems-ba2d86ac5837)\n- [Unblackboxing webinar (deepsense.io)](https://github.com/deepsense-io/unblackboxing_webinar)\n- [The Dark Secret at the Heart of AI](https://www.technologyreview.com/s/604087/the-dark-secret-at-the-heart-of-ai/amp/)\n- [How AI detectives are cracking open the black box of deep learning](http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2017/07/how-ai-detectives-are-cracking-open-black-box-deep-learning)\n- [Visualization of activations and filters](https://blog.keras.io/how-convolutional-neural-networks-see-the-world.html) \n\t- https://github.com/jacobgil/keras-filter-visualization\n- https://towardsdatascience.com/understanding-your-convolution-network-with-visualizations-a4883441533b\n- https://imatge.upc.edu/web/publications/visual-saliency-prediction-using-deep-learning-techniques\n- [Attributing a deep network’s prediction to its input features](http://www.unofficialgoogledatascience.com/2017/03/attributing-deep-networks-prediction-to.html)\n\t- Integrated gradients method\n\t- It involves a few calls to a gradient operator yielding insightful results for a variety of deep networks\n- [Pixel Attribution (Saliency Maps)](https://christophm.github.io/interpretable-ml-book/pixel-attribution.html)\n\n  \n#### References\n- #PAPER [Visualization of neural networks using saliency maps (Morch 1995)](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/3623243_Visualization_of_neural_networks_using_saliency_maps)\n- #PAPER [Deep inside CNNs: Visualising Image Classification Models and Saliency Maps (Simonyan 2014)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1312.6034)\n\t- Presented two visualisation techniques for deep classification ConvNets\n\t\t- The first generates an artificial image, which is representative of a class of interest\n\t\t- The second computes an image-specific class saliency map, highlighting the areas of the given image, discriminative wrt the given class\n- #PAPER [Understanding Neural Networks Through Deep Visualization (Yosinski 2015)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1506.06579)\n\t- http://yosinski.com/deepvis\n- #PAPER [SVCCA: Singular Vector Canonical Correlation Analysis for Deep Learning Dynamics and Interpretability (Raghu 2017)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.05806)\n\t- [Interpreting Deep Neural Networks with SVCCA](https://ai.googleblog.com/2017/11/interpreting-deep-neural-networks-with.html)\n- #PAPER [Axiomatic Attribution for Deep Networks (Sundararajan 2017)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.01365)\n- #PAPER [SmoothGrad: removing noise by adding noise (Smilkov 2017)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03825)\n\t- https://pair-code.github.io/saliency/\n- #PAPER [iNNvestigate Neural Networks!

The first reference of saliency maps applied to the predictions of DNNs is Morch et al 1995. Simonyan et al (2014) first proposed a method to produce saliency maps using back-propagation through a CNN, but note that you could compute \"saliency\" from an image in many ways that do not deal with back-propagating the prediction scores of DNNs. \n- There are several approaches for calculating attributions by back-propagating the prediction score through each layer of the network, back to the input features /pixels (DeConvNet, SmoothGrad, GradCam, LRP, XRAI). LRP is just one of them. In the first LRP paper, they talk about heatmaps or relevance maps, probably to avoid confusion with older saliency map techniques\n\n- #PAPER [On Pixel-Wise Explanations for Non-Linear Classifier Decisions by Layer-Wise Relevance Propagation (Bach 2015)](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0130140)\n\t- #CODE [Tutorial: Implementing Layer-Wise Relevance Propagation](https://git.tu-berlin.de/gmontavon/lrp-tutorial)\n- #PAPER [Understanding Individual Decisions of CNNs via Contrastive Backpropagation (Gu 2019)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1812.02100)\n- #PAPER [Beyond saliency: understanding convolutional neural networks from saliency prediction on layer-wise relevance propagation (Li 2019)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1712.08268)\n\t- proposed a novel two-step understanding method, namely Salient Relevance (SR) map, which aims to shed light on how deep CNNs recognize images and learn features from attention areas\n\t- starts out with a layer-wise relevance propagation (LRP) step which estimates a pixel-wise relevance map over the input image.
